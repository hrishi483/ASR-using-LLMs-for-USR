WE TOO HAVE STILL OUR VIRTUES ALTHOUGH NATURALLY THEY ARE NOT THOSE SINCERE AND MASSIVE VIRTUES ON ACCOUNT OF WHICH WE HOLD OUR GRANDFATHERS IN ESTEEMAND ALSO AT A LITTLE DISTANCE FROM US WE EUROPEANS OF THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW WE FIRSTLINGS OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY WITH ALL OUR DANGEROUS CURIOSITY OUR MULTIFARIOUSNESS AND ART OF DISGUISINGWITH OUR MOST ARDENT REQUIREMENTS WELL THEN LET US LOOK FOR THEM IN OUR LABYRINTHS WHERE AS WE KNOW SO MANY THINGS LOSE THEMSELVES SO MANY THINGS GET QUITE LOSTAND IS THERE ANYTHING FINER THAN TO SEARCH FOR ONE'S OWN VIRTUES IS IT NOT ALMOST TO BELIEVE IN ONE'S OWN VIRTUES BUT THIS BELIEVING IN ONE'S OWN VIRTUESIT WILL BE DIFFERENT TWO HUNDRED FIFTEEN AS IN THE STELLAR FIRMAMENT THERE ARE SOMETIMES TWO SUNS WHICH DETERMINE THE PATH OF ONE PLANETNOW WITH RED LIGHT NOW WITH GREENSO WE MODERN MEN OWING TO THE COMPLICATED MECHANISM OF OUR FIRMAMENT ARE DETERMINED BY DIFFERENT MORALITIESAND ARE SELDOM UNEQUIVOCAL AND THERE ARE OFTEN CASES ALSO IN WHICH OUR ACTIONS ARE MOTLEY COLOUREDINDEED AT TIMES THE HIGHER AND SUBLIMER THING TAKES PLACE WE LEARN TO DESPISE WHEN WE LOVE AND PRECISELY WHEN WE LOVE BEST ALL OF IT HOWEVER UNCONSCIOUSLY WITHOUT NOISEIS OPPOSED TO OUR TASTE NOWADAYS THIS IS ALSO AN ADVANCE AS IT WAS AN ADVANCE IN OUR FATHERS THAT RELIGION AS AN ATTITUDE FINALLY BECAME OPPOSED TO THEIR TASTE INCLUDING THE ENMITYAND VOLTAIREAN BITTERNESS AGAINST RELIGION AND ALL THAT FORMERLY BELONGED TO FREETHINKER PANTOMIME IT IS THE MUSIC IN OUR CONSCIENCE THE DANCE IN OUR SPIRIT TO WHICH PURITAN LITANIESMORAL SERMONS AND GOODY GOODNESS WON'T CHIMELET US BE CAREFUL IN DEALING WITH THOSE WHO ATTACH GREAT IMPORTANCE TO BEING CREDITED WITH MORAL TACT AND SUBTLETY IN MORAL DISCERNMENT THEY NEVER FORGIVE US IF THEY HAVE ONCE MADE A MISTAKE BEFORE USFOR THEY GET THE BETTER EVEN OF THEIR BLUNDERSJUST AS THOUGH IN SHORT THEY BETRAY SOMETHING THEREBY FLAUBERT FOR INSTANCEI WOULD NOW RECOMMEND FOR A CHANGE SOMETHING ELSE FOR A PLEASURE NAMELY THE UNCONSCIOUS ASTUTENESS WITH WHICH GOOD FAT HONEST MEDIOCRITY ALWAYS BEHAVES TOWARDS LOFTIER SPIRITSSUBTLER EVEN THAN THE UNDERSTANDING OF ITS VICTIMS A REPEATED PROOF THAT INSTINCT IS THE MOST INTELLIGENT OF ALL KINDS OF INTELLIGENCE WHICH HAVE HITHERTO BEEN DISCOVEREDTWO HUNDRED NINETEEN THE PRACTICE OF JUDGING AND CONDEMNING MORALLY IS THE FAVOURITE REVENGE OF THE INTELLECTUALLY SHALLOW ON THOSE WHO ARE LESS SOIT IS ALSO A KIND OF INDEMNITY FOR THEIR BEING BADLY ENDOWED BY NATURE AND FINALLY IT IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ACQUIRING SPIRIT AND BECOMING SUBTLEMALICE SPIRITUALISES THEY ARE GLAD IN THEIR INMOST HEART THAT THERE IS A STANDARD ACCORDING TO WHICH THOSE WHO ARE OVER ENDOWED WITH INTELLECTUAL GOODS AND PRIVILEGES ARE EQUAL TO THEMI SHALL TAKE CARE NOT TO SAY SO I WOULD RATHER FLATTER THEM WITH MY THEORY THAT LOFTY SPIRITUALITY ITSELF EXISTS ONLY AS THE ULTIMATE PRODUCT OF MORAL QUALITIESIS PRECISELY THE SPIRITUALISING OF JUSTICEGRADATIONS OF RANK IN THE WORLD EVEN AMONG THINGS AND NOT ONLY AMONG MENAND WHAT ARE THE THINGS GENERALLY WHICH FUNDAMENTALLY AND PROFOUNDLY CONCERN ORDINARY MEN INCLUDING THE CULTURED EVEN THE LEARNED AND PERHAPS PHILOSOPHERS ALSO IF APPEARANCES DO NOT DECEIVETHE FACT THEREBY BECOMES OBVIOUS THAT THE GREATER PART OF WHAT INTERESTS AND CHARMS HIGHER NATURES AND MORE REFINED AND FASTIDIOUS TASTES SEEMS ABSOLUTELY UNINTERESTING TO THE AVERAGE MAN IFNOTWITHSTANDING HE PERCEIVE DEVOTION TO THESE INTERESTS HE CALLS IT DESINTERESSE AND WONDERS HOW IT IS POSSIBLE TO ACT DISINTERESTEDLY THERE HAVE BEEN PHILOSOPHERSWHO COULD GIVE THIS POPULAR ASTONISHMENT A SEDUCTIVE AND MYSTICAL OTHER WORLDLY EXPRESSION PERHAPS BECAUSE THEY DID NOT KNOW THE HIGHER NATURE BY EXPERIENCE INSTEAD OF STATINGEVEN AN ACTION FOR LOVE'S SAKE SHALL BE UNEGOISTIC BUT YOU FOOLS AND THE PRAISE OF THE SELF SACRIFICER BUT WHOEVER HAS REALLY OFFERED SACRIFICE KNOWSTHAT HE WANTED AND OBTAINED SOMETHING FOR IT PERHAPS SOMETHING FROM HIMSELF FOR SOMETHING FROM HIMSELF THAT HE RELINQUISHED HERE IN ORDER TO HAVE MORE THERE PERHAPS IN GENERAL TO BE MORETHAT I HONOUR AND RESPECT AN UNSELFISH MAN NOT HOWEVER BECAUSE HE IS UNSELFISH BUT BECAUSE I THINK HE HAS A RIGHT TO BE USEFUL TO ANOTHER MAN AT HIS OWN EXPENSE IN SHORT THE QUESTION IS ALWAYSAND WHO THE OTHER IS FOR INSTANCE IN A PERSON CREATED AND DESTINED FOR COMMAND SELF DENIAL AND MODEST RETIREMENT INSTEAD OF BEING VIRTUES WOULD BE THE WASTE OF VIRTUESSO IT SEEMS TO ME EVERY SYSTEM OF UNEGOISTIC MORALITY WHICH TAKES ITSELF UNCONDITIONALLY AND APPEALS TO EVERY ONE NOT ONLY SINS AGAINST GOOD TASTEBUT IS ALSO AN INCENTIVE TO SINS OF OMISSION AN ADDITIONAL SEDUCTION UNDER THE MASK OF PHILANTHROPY AND PRECISELY A SEDUCTION AND INJURY TO THE HIGHER RARER AND MORE PRIVILEGED TYPES OF MENMORAL SYSTEMS MUST BE COMPELLED FIRST OF ALL TO BOW BEFORE THE GRADATIONS OF RANK THEIR PRESUMPTION MUST BE DRIVEN HOME TO THEIR CONSCIENCE UNTIL THEY THOROUGHLY UNDERSTAND AT LASTTHAT IT IS IMMORAL TO SAY THAT WHAT IS RIGHT FOR ONE IS PROPER FOR ANOTHER SO SAID MY MORALISTIC PEDANT AND BONHOMMEDID HE PERHAPS DESERVE TO BE LAUGHED AT WHEN HE THUS EXHORTED SYSTEMS OF MORALS TO PRACTISE MORALITY BUT ONE SHOULD NOT BE TOO MUCH IN THE RIGHTFELLOW SUFFERING IS PREACHED NOWADAYS AND IF I GATHER RIGHTLY NO OTHER RELIGION IS ANY LONGER PREACHED LET THE PSYCHOLOGIST HAVE HIS EARS OPEN THROUGH ALL THE VANITY THROUGH ALL THE NOISE WHICH IS NATURAL TO THESE PREACHERSAS TO ALL PREACHERS HE WILL HEAR A HOARSE GROANING GENUINE NOTE OF SELF CONTEMPT IT BELONGS TO THE OVERSHADOWING AND UGLIFYING OF EUROPE WHICH HAS BEEN ON THE INCREASE FOR A CENTURYTHE FIRST SYMPTOMS OF WHICH ARE ALREADY SPECIFIED DOCUMENTARILY IN A THOUGHTFUL LETTER OF GALIANI TO MADAME D'EPINAY IF IT IS NOT REALLY THE CAUSE THEREOF THE MAN OF MODERN IDEASTHE HYBRID EUROPEAN A TOLERABLY UGLY PLEBEIAN TAKEN ALL IN ALL ABSOLUTELY REQUIRES A COSTUME HE NEEDS HISTORY AS A STOREROOM OF COSTUMESTO BE SURE HE NOTICES THAT NONE OF THE COSTUMES FIT HIM PROPERLY HE CHANGES AND CHANGES LET US LOOK AT THE NINETEENTH CENTURY WITH RESPECT TO THESE HASTY PREFERENCES AND CHANGES IN ITS MASQUERADES OF STYLEAND ALSO WITH RESPECT TO ITS MOMENTS OF DESPERATION ON ACCOUNT OF NOTHING SUITING US IT IS IN VAIN TO GET OURSELVES UP AS ROMANTIC OR CLASSICAL OR CHRISTIANOR FLORENTINE OR BAROCCO OR NATIONAL IN MORIBUS ET ARTIBUS IT DOES NOT CLOTHE US BUT THE SPIRIT ESPECIALLY THEHISTORICAL SPIRIT PROFITS EVEN BY THIS DESPERATION ONCE AND AGAIN A NEW SAMPLE OF THE PAST OR OF THE

FOR THE RELATION OF THE AUTHORITY OF THE VALUATIONS TO THE AUTHORITY OF THE OPERATING FORCES THIS HISTORICAL SENSEHAS COME TO US IN THE TRAIN OF THE ENCHANTING AND MAD SEMI BARBARITY INTO WHICH EUROPE HAS BEEN PLUNGED BY THE DEMOCRATIC MINGLING OF CLASSES AND RACES IT IS ONLY THE NINETEENTH CENTURY THAT HAS RECOGNIZED THIS FACULTYAS ITS SIXTH SENSE OWING TO THIS MINGLING THE PAST OF EVERY FORM AND MODE OF LIFE AND OF CULTURES WHICH WERE FORMERLY CLOSELY CONTIGUOUS AND SUPERIMPOSED ON ONE ANOTHER FLOWS FORTH INTO USBY MEANS OF OUR SEMI BARBARITY IN BODY AND IN DESIRE WE HAVE SECRET ACCESS EVERYWHERE SUCH AS A NOBLE AGE NEVER HAD WE HAVE ACCESS ABOVE ALL TO THE LABYRINTH OF IMPERFECT CIVILIZATIONSAND TO EVERY FORM OF SEMI BARBARITY THAT HAS AT ANY TIME EXISTED ON EARTH AND IN SO FAR AS THE MOST CONSIDERABLE PART OF HUMAN CIVILIZATION HITHERTO HAS JUST BEEN SEMI BARBARITYTHE HISTORICAL SENSE IMPLIES ALMOST THE SENSE AND INSTINCT FOR EVERYTHING THE TASTE AND TONGUE FOR EVERYTHING WHEREBY IT IMMEDIATELY PROVES ITSELF TO BE AN IGNOBLE SENSE FOR INSTANCEWE ENJOY HOMER ONCE MORE IT IS PERHAPS OUR HAPPIEST ACQUISITION THAT WE KNOW HOW TO APPRECIATE HOMER WHOM MEN OF DISTINGUISHED CULTUREESPRIT VASTE AND EVEN VOLTAIRE THE LAST ECHO OF THE CENTURY CANNOT AND COULD NOT SO EASILY APPROPRIATE WHOM THEY SCARCELY PERMITTED THEMSELVES TO ENJOY THE VERY DECIDED YEAA DISSATISFACTION WITH ITS OWN CONDITION OR AN ADMIRATION OF WHAT IS STRANGE ALL THIS DETERMINES AND DISPOSES THEM UNFAVOURABLY EVEN TOWARDS THE BEST THINGS OF THE WORLD WHICH ARE NOT THEIR PROPERTYOR COULD NOT BECOME THEIR PREY AND NO FACULTY IS MORE UNINTELLIGIBLE TO SUCH MEN THAN JUST THIS HISTORICAL SENSE WITH ITS TRUCKLING PLEBEIAN CURIOSITYTHE CASE IS NOT DIFFERENT WITH SHAKESPEARE THAT MARVELOUS SPANISH MOORISH SAXON SYNTHESIS OF TASTE OVER WHOM AN ANCIENT ATHENIANWITH A SECRET CONFIDENCE AND CORDIALITY WE ENJOY IT AS A REFINEMENT OF ART RESERVED EXPRESSLY FOR US AND ALLOW OURSELVES TO BE AS LITTLE DISTURBED BY THE REPULSIVE FUMES AND THE PROXIMITY OF THE ENGLISH POPULACEIN WHICH SHAKESPEARE'S ART AND TASTE LIVES AS PERHAPS ON THE CHIAJA OF NAPLES WHERE WITH ALL OUR SENSES AWAKE WE GO OUR WAY ENCHANTED AND VOLUNTARILYLET US FINALLY CONFESS IT THAT WHAT IS MOST DIFFICULT FOR US MEN OF THE HISTORICAL SENSE TO GRASP FEEL TASTE AND LOVE WHAT FINDS US FUNDAMENTALLY PREJUDICED AND ALMOST HOSTILEIS PRECISELY THE PERFECTION AND ULTIMATE MATURITY IN EVERY CULTURE AND ART THE ESSENTIALLY NOBLE IN WORKS AND MEN THEIR MOMENT OF SMOOTH SEA AND HALCYON SELF SUFFICIENCYTHE GOLDENNESS AND COLDNESS WHICH ALL THINGS SHOW THAT HAVE PERFECTED THEMSELVES PERHAPS OUR GREAT VIRTUE OF THE HISTORICAL SENSE IS IN NECESSARY CONTRAST TO GOOD TASTEAT LEAST TO THE VERY BAD TASTE AND WE CAN ONLY EVOKE IN OURSELVES IMPERFECTLY HESITATINGLY AND WITH COMPULSION THE SMALL SHORT AND HAPPY GODSENDS AND GLORIFICATIONS OF HUMAN LIFEAS THEY SHINE HERE AND THERE THOSE MOMENTS AND MARVELOUS EXPERIENCES WHEN A GREAT POWER HAS VOLUNTARILY COME TO A HALT BEFORE THE BOUNDLESS AND INFINITE WHEN A SUPER ABUNDANCE OF REFINED DELIGHT HAS BEEN ENJOYEDOUR ITCHING IS REALLY THE ITCHING FOR THE INFINITE THE IMMEASURABLE LIKE THE RIDER ON HIS FORWARD PANTING HORSE WE LET THE REINS FALL BEFORE THE INFINITE WE MODERN MEN WE SEMI BARBARIANSWHETHER IT BE HEDONISM PESSIMISM UTILITARIANISM OR EUDAEMONISM ALL THOSE MODES OF THINKING WHICH MEASURE THE WORTH OF THINGS ACCORDING TO PLEASURE AND PAINTHAT IS ACCORDING TO ACCOMPANYING CIRCUMSTANCES AND SECONDARY CONSIDERATIONS ARE PLAUSIBLE MODES OF THOUGHT AND NAIVETES WHICH EVERY ONE CONSCIOUS OF CREATIVE POWERS AND AN ARTIST'S CONSCIENCEFOR SOCIETY WITH ITS SICK AND MISFORTUNED FOR THE HEREDITARILY VICIOUS AND DEFECTIVE WHO LIE ON THE GROUND AROUND US STILL LESS IS IT SYMPATHY FOR THE GRUMBLINGWHO STRIVE AFTER POWER THEY CALL IT FREEDOM OUR SYMPATHY IS A LOFTIER AND FURTHER SIGHTED SYMPATHY WE SEE HOW MAN DWARFS HIMSELF HOW YOU DWARF HIMAND MAKES HIS DESTRUCTION DESIRABLE THE DISCIPLINE OF SUFFERING OF GREAT SUFFERING KNOW YE NOT THAT IT IS ONLY THIS DISCIPLINE THAT HAS PRODUCED ALL THE ELEVATIONS OF HUMANITY HITHERTOTHE TENSION OF SOUL IN MISFORTUNE WHICH COMMUNICATES TO IT ITS ENERGY ITS SHUDDERING IN VIEW OF RACK AND RUIN ITS INVENTIVENESS AND BRAVERY IN UNDERGOING ENDURINGCREATURE AND CREATOR ARE UNITED IN MAN THERE IS NOT ONLY MATTER SHRED EXCESS CLAY MIRE FOLLY CHAOS BUT THERE IS ALSO THE CREATORTHE SCULPTOR THE HARDNESS OF THE HAMMER THE DIVINITY OF THE SPECTATOR AND THE SEVENTH DAY DO YE UNDERSTAND THIS CONTRAST AND THAT YOUR SYMPATHY FOR THE CREATURE IN MANAPPLIES TO THAT WHICH HAS TO BE FASHIONED BRUISED FORGED STRETCHED ROASTED ANNEALED REFINEDSO IT IS SYMPATHY AGAINST SYMPATHY BUT TO REPEAT IT ONCE MORE THERE ARE HIGHER PROBLEMS THAN THE PROBLEMS OF PLEASURE AND PAIN AND SYMPATHYAND ALL SYSTEMS OF PHILOSOPHY WHICH DEAL ONLY WITH THESE ARE NAIVETES TWO HUNDRED TWENTY SIXIN WHICH WE HAVE TO FEAR AND LOVE THIS ALMOST INVISIBLE INAUDIBLE WORLD OF DELICATE COMMAND AND DELICATE OBEDIENCE A WORLD OF ALMOST IN EVERY RESPECT CAPTIOUS INSIDIOUS SHARPAND TENDER YES IT IS WELL PROTECTED FROM CLUMSY SPECTATORS AND FAMILIAR CURIOSITY WE ARE WOVEN INTO A STRONG NET AND GARMENT OF DUTIES AND CANNOT DISENGAGE OURSELVESPRECISELY HERE WE ARE MEN OF DUTY EVEN WE OCCASIONALLY IT IS TRUE WE DANCE IN OUR CHAINS AND BETWIXT OUR SWORDSTHESE ARE MEN WITHOUT DUTY WE HAVE ALWAYS FOOLS AND APPEARANCES AGAINST USHONESTY GRANTING THAT IT IS THE VIRTUE OF WHICH WE CANNOT RID OURSELVES WE FREE SPIRITS WELL WE WILL LABOUR AT IT WITH ALL OUR PERVERSITY AND LOVEAND NOT TIRE OF PERFECTING OURSELVES IN OUR VIRTUE WHICH ALONE REMAINS MAY ITS GLANCE SOME DAY OVERSPREAD LIKE A GILDED BLUE MOCKING TWILIGHTLET US GO WITH ALL OUR DEVILS TO THE HELP OF OUR GOD IT IS PROBABLE THAT PEOPLE WILL MISUNDERSTAND AND MISTAKE US ON THAT ACCOUNT WHAT DOES IT MATTERTHEY WILL SAY THEIR HONESTY' THAT IS THEIR DEVILRY AND NOTHING ELSE WHAT DOES IT MATTER AND EVEN IF THEY WERE RIGHT HAVE NOT ALL GODS HITHERTO BEEN SUCH SANCTIFIEDOUR STUPIDITY EVERY VIRTUE INCLINES TO STUPIDITY EVERY STUPIDITY TO VIRTUE STUPID TO THE POINT OF SANCTITY THEY SAY IN RUSSIA LET US BE CAREFUL LESTHAS BEEN MORE INJURED BY THE TEDIOUSNESS OF ITS ADVOCATES THAN BY ANYTHING ELSE AT THE SAME TIME HOWEVER I WOULD NOT WISH TO OVERLOOK THEIR GENERAL USEFULNESSIT IS DESIRABLE THAT AS FEW PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE SHOULD REFLECT UPON MORALS AND CONSEQUENTLY IT IS VERY DESIRABLE THAT MORALS SHOULD NOT SOME DAY BECOME INTERESTINGBUT LET US NOT BE AFRAID THINGS STILL REMAIN TODAY AS THEY HAVE ALWAYS BEEN I SEE NO ONE IN EUROPE WHO HAS OR DISCLOSES AN IDEA OF THE FACT THAT PHILOSOPHIZING CONCERNING MORALSINEVITABLE ENGLISH UTILITARIANS HOW PONDEROUSLY AND RESPECTABLY THEY STALK ON STALK ALONG A HOMERIC METAPHOR EXPRESSES IT BETTER IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF BENTHAMJUST AS HE HAD ALREADY STALKED IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF THE RESPECTABLE HELVETIUS NO HE WAS NOT A DANGEROUS MAN HELVETIUS C E SENATEUR POCOCURANTE TO USE AN EXPRESSION OF GALIANINO NEW THOUGHT NOTHING OF THE NATURE OF A FINER TURNING OR BETTER EXPRESSION OF AN OLD THOUGHT NOT EVEN A PROPER HISTORY OF WHAT HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT ON THE SUBJECT AN IMPOSSIBLE LITERATUREHAS INSINUATED ITSELF ALSO INTO THESE MORALISTS WHOM ONE MUST CERTAINLY READ WITH AN EYE TO THEIR MOTIVES IF ONE MUST READ THEM CONCEALED THIS TIME UNDER THE NEW FORM OF THE SCIENTIFIC SPIRITIS NOT A MORALIST THE OPPOSITE OF A PURITAN THAT IS TO SAY AS A THINKER WHO REGARDS MORALITY AS QUESTIONABLE AS WORTHY OF INTERROGATION IN SHORT AS A PROBLEMIS MORALIZING NOT IMMORAL IN THE END THEY ALL WANT ENGLISH MORALITY TO BE RECOGNIZED AS AUTHORITATIVE INASMUCH AS MANKIND OR THE GENERAL UTILITYOR THE HAPPINESS OF

EXTENT OF THE MEANING OF THAT ACTONCE THERE LIVED A KING WHO HAD NO CHILDREN FOR MANY YEARS AFTER HIS MARRIAGE AT LENGTH HEAVEN GRANTED HIM A DAUGHTER OF SUCH REMARKABLE BEAUTY THAT HE COULD THINK OF NO NAME SO APPROPRIATE FOR HER AS FAIRER THAN A FAIRYTHAN THEY RESOLVED TO GAIN POSSESSION OF HER WHO BORE IT AND EITHER TO TORMENT HER CRUELLY OR AT LEAST TO CONCEAL HER FROM THE EYES OF ALL MEN THE ELDEST OF THEIR TRIBE WAS ENTRUSTED TO CARRY OUT THEIR REVENGE THIS FAIRY WAS NAMED LAGREESHE WAS SO OLD THAT SHE ONLY HAD ONE EYE AND ONE TOOTH LEFTSHE WAS ALSO SO SPITEFUL THAT SHE GLADLY DEVOTED ALL HER TIME TO CARRYING OUT ALL THE MEAN OR ILL NATURED TRICKS OF THE WHOLE BODY OF FAIRIES WITH HER LARGE EXPERIENCE ADDED TO HER NATIVE SPITESHE FELT A LITTLE REASSURED AND WAS FURTHER CHEERED WHEN SHE DISCOVERED THAT HER PET CAT AND DOG HAD FOLLOWED HERAT THE SAME TIME GIVING HER THE STRICTEST ORDERS NEVER TO LET OUT THE FIRE WHICH WAS BURNING BRIGHTLY IN THE GRATE SHE THEN GAVE TWO GLASS BOTTLES INTO THE PRINCESS'S CHARGE DESIRING HER TO TAKE THE GREATEST CARE OF THEMAND HAVING ENFORCED HER ORDERS WITH THE MOST AWFUL THREATS IN CASE OF DISOBEDIENCE SHE VANISHED LEAVING THE LITTLE GIRL AT LIBERTY TO EXPLORE THE PALACESEVERAL YEARS PASSED DURING WHICH TIME THE PRINCESS GREW ACCUSTOMED TO HER LONELY LIFE OBEYED THE FAIRY'S ORDERS AND BY DEGREES FORGOT ALL ABOUT THE COURT OF THE KING

WHICH SEEMED TO COME FROM THE CENTRE OF ITS RAYSTHE VOICE WAS THAT OF A YOUNG MAN AND ITS SWEETNESS OF TONE AND THE AGREEABLE THINGS IT UTTERED LED ONE TO INFER THAT ITS OWNER MUST BE EQUALLY CHARMING

PARENTS A GRUDGEHAD REVENGED HERSELF BY DEPRIVING HIM OF HIS NATURAL SHAPE FOR SOME YEARS THAT SHE HAD IMPRISONED HIM IN THE PALACE WHERE HE HAD FOUND HIS CONFINEMENT HARD TO BEAR FOR SOME TIME BUT NOW HE OWNEDHE NO LONGER SIGHED FOR FREEDOM SINCE HE HAD SEEN AND LEARNED TO LOVE FAIRER THAN A FAIRY HE ADDED MANY OTHER TENDER SPEECHES TO THIS DECLARATION AND THE PRINCESS TO WHOM SUCH REMARKS WERE A NEW EXPERIENCECOULD NOT HELP FEELING PLEASED AND TOUCHED BY HIS ATTENTIONS THE PRINCE COULD ONLY APPEAR OR SPEAK UNDER THE FORM OF A RAINBOW AND IT WAS THEREFORE NECESSARY THAT THE SUN SHOULD SHINE ON WATER SO AS TO ENABLE THE RAYS TO FORM THEMSELVESLAGREE ON HER RETURN SOON FOUND OUT THE NEGLECT AND SEEMED ONLY TOO PLEASED TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY OF SHOWING HER SPITE TO HER LOVELY PRISONERFOR FIRE WITH WHICH TO RELIGHT THE ONE SHE HAD ALLOWED TO GO OUT NOW THIS LOCRINOS WAS A CRUEL MONSTER WHO DEVOURED EVERYONE HE CAME ACROSS AND ESPECIALLY ENJOYED A CHANCE OF CATCHINGAND EATING ANY YOUNG GIRLS OUR HEROINE OBEYED WITH GREAT SWEETNESS AND WITHOUT HAVING BEEN ABLE TO TAKE LEAVE OF HER LOVERAS TO CERTAIN DEATH AS SHE WAS CROSSING A WOOD A BIRD SANG TO HER TO PICK UP A SHINING PEBBLE WHICH SHE WOULD FIND IN A FOUNTAIN CLOSE BY AND TO USE IT WHEN NEEDEDSHE TOOK THE BIRD'S ADVICE AND IN DUE TIME ARRIVED AT THE HOUSE OF LOCRINOS LUCKILY SHE ONLY FOUND HIS WIFE AT HOME WHO WAS MUCH STRUCK BY THE PRINCESS'S YOUTH AND BEAUTY AND SWEET GENTLE MANNERSSHE READILY LET FAIRER THAN A FAIRY HAVE THE FIRECONVENIENT WAY OF MEETING THAN BY THE GARDEN FOUNTAIN AND FAIRER THAN A FAIRY CARRIED OUT HIS PLAN DAILY WITH ENTIRE SUCCESS EVERY MORNING SHE PLACED A LARGE BASIN FULL OF WATER ON HER WINDOW SILL AND AS SOON AS THE SUN'S RAYS FELL ON THE WATERTHE RAINBOW APPEARED AS CLEARLY AS IT HAD EVER DONE IN THE FOUNTAIN BY THIS MEANS THEY WERE ABLE TO MEET WITHOUT LOSING SIGHT OF THE FIRE OR OF THE TWO BOTTLES IN WHICH THE OLD FAIRY KEPT HER EYE AND HER TOOTH AT NIGHTAND FOR SOME TIME THE LOVERS ENJOYED EVERY HOUR OF SUNSHINE TOGETHER ONE DAY PRINCE RAINBOW APPEARED IN THE DEPTHS OF WOE HE HAD JUST HEARD THAT HE WAS TO BE BANISHED FROM THIS LOVELY SPOT BUT HE HAD NO IDEA WHERE HE WAS TO GOTHE

SUN BROKE THROUGH THE CLOUDS FOR A FEW MINUTESFAIRER THAN A FAIRY EAGERLY RAN TO THE WINDOW BUT IN HER HASTE SHE UPSET THE BASIN AND SPILT ALL THE WATER WITH WHICH SHE HAD CAREFULLY FILLED IT OVERNIGHT NO OTHER WATER WAS AT HAND EXCEPT THAT IN THE TWO BOTTLESIT WAS THE ONLY CHANCE OF SEEING HER LOVER BEFORE THEY WERE SEPARATED AND SHE DID NOT HESITATE TO BREAK THE BOTTLE AND POUR THEIR CONTENTS INTO THE BASIN WHEN THE RAINBOW APPEARED AT ONCE THEIR FAREWELLS WERE FULL OF TENDERNESSTHE PRINCE MADE THE MOST ARDENT AND SINCERE PROTESTATIONS AND PROMISED TO NEGLECT NOTHING WHICH MIGHT HELP TO DELIVER HIS DEAR FAIRER THAN A FAIRY FROM HER CAPTIVITY AND IMPLORED HER TO CONSENT TO THEIR MARRIAGE AS SOON AS THEY SHOULD BOTH BE FREETHE PRINCESS ON HER SIDE VOWED TO HAVE NO OTHER HUSBAND AND DECLARED HERSELF WILLING TO BRAVE DEATH ITSELF IN ORDER TO REJOIN HIM THEY WERE NOT ALLOWED MUCH TIME FOR THEIR ADIEUS THE RAINBOW VANISHED AND THE PRINCESS RESOLVED TO RUN ALL RISKSSTARTED OFF AT ONCE TAKING NOTHING WITH HER BUT HER DOG HER CAT A SPRIG OF MYRTLE AND THE STONE WHICH THE WIFE OF LOCRINOS GAVE HER WHEN LAGREE BECAME AWARE OF HER PRISONER'S FLIGHTAS SHE DID SO THE SPRIG OF MYRTLE

PLEASANT THOUGHTS AFTER A TIME HER ROAD LED THROUGH A WOOD FULL OF SOFT AIRS AND SWEET ODOURS AND BEFORE SHE HAD GONE A HUNDRED YARDS SHE SAW A WONDERFUL SILVER CASTLEFAIRER THAN A FAIRY FELT A STRONG DESIRE TO ENTER THIS CASTLE BUT BESIDES BEING HUNG A LITTLE ABOVE THE GROUND THERE SEEMED TO BE NEITHER DOORS NOR WINDOWS SHE HAD NO DOUBT THOUGH REALLY I CANNOT THINK WHYTHAT THE MOMENT HAD COME IN WHICH TO USE THE NUT WHICH HAD BEEN GIVEN HER SHE OPENED IT AND OUT CAME A DIMINUTIVE HALL PORTERYOU EVER SAW THE PRINCESS CLIMBED UP ONE OF THE SILVER CHAINS HOLDING IN HER HAND THE LITTLE PORTER WHO IN SPITE OF HIS MINUTE SIZE OPENED A SECRET DOOR WITH HIS GOLDEN KEY AND LET HER INSHE ENTERED A MAGNIFICENT ROOM WHICH APPEARED TO OCCUPY THE ENTIRE CASTLE AND WHICH WAS LIGHTED BY GOLD AND JEWELLED

THAT PERIOD PLACES MANNERS BOOKS AND OPINIONS HAVE UNDERGONE CONSIDERABLE CHANGESCHAPTER ONE NO ONE WHO HAD EVER SEEN CATHERINE MORLAND IN HER INFANCY WOULD HAVE SUPPOSED HER BORN TO BE AN HEROINE HER SITUATION IN LIFETHE CHARACTER OF HER FATHER AND MOTHER HER OWN PERSON AND DISPOSITION WERE ALL EQUALLY AGAINST HER HER FATHER WAS A CLERGYMAN WITHOUT BEING NEGLECTED OR POOR AND A VERY RESPECTABLE MANHER MOTHER WAS A WOMAN OF USEFUL PLAIN SENSE WITH A GOOD TEMPER AND WHAT IS MORE REMARKABLE WITH A GOOD CONSTITUTION SHE HAD THREE SONS BEFORE CATHERINE WAS BORNWHERE THERE ARE HEADS AND ARMS AND LEGS ENOUGH FOR THE NUMBER BUT THE MORLANDS HAD LITTLE OTHER RIGHT TO THE WORD FOR THEY WERE IN GENERAL VERY PLAIN AND CATHERINE FOR MANY YEARS OF HER LIFE AS PLAIN AS ANYSHE HAD A THIN AWKWARD FIGUREDARK LANK HAIR AND STRONG FEATURES SO MUCH FOR HER PERSON AND NOT LESS UNPROPITIOUS FOR HEROISM SEEMED HER MIND SHE WAS FOND OF ALL BOY'S PLAYS AND GREATLY PREFERRED CRICKETNOT MERELY TO DOLLS BUT TO THE MORE HEROIC ENJOYMENTS OF INFANCY NURSING A DORMOUSE FEEDING A CANARY BIRD OR WATERING A ROSE BUSH INDEED SHE HAD NO TASTE FOR A GARDENAND IF SHE GATHERED FLOWERS AT ALL IT WAS CHIEFLY FOR THE PLEASURE OF MISCHIEF AT LEAST SO IT WAS CONJECTURED FROM HER ALWAYS PREFERRING THOSE WHICH SHE WAS FORBIDDEN TO TAKE SUCH WERE HER PROPENSITIESHER ABILITIES WERE QUITE AS EXTRAORDINARY SHE NEVER COULD LEARN OR UNDERSTAND ANYTHING BEFORE SHE WAS TAUGHT AND SOMETIMES NOT EVEN THEN FOR SHE WAS OFTEN INATTENTIVE AND OCCASIONALLY STUPIDHER MOTHER WAS THREE MONTHS IN TEACHING HER ONLY TO REPEAT THE BEGGAR'S PETITION AND AFTER ALL HER NEXT SISTER SALLY COULD SAY IT BETTER THAN SHE DID NOT THAT CATHERINE WAS ALWAYS STUPID BY NO MEANSSHE LEARNT THE FABLE OF THE HARE AND MANY FRIENDS AS QUICKLY AS ANY GIRL IN ENGLAND HER MOTHER WISHED HER TO LEARN MUSIC AND CATHERINE WAS SURE SHE SHOULD LIKE IT FOR SHE WAS VERY FOND OF TINKLING THE KEYS OF THE OLD FORLORN SPINNETSO AT EIGHT YEARS OLD SHE BEGAN SHE LEARNT A YEAR AND COULD NOT BEAR IT AND MISSUS MORLAND WHO DID NOT INSIST ON HER DAUGHTERS BEING ACCOMPLISHED IN SPITE OF INCAPACITY OR DISTASTE ALLOWED HER TO LEAVE OFFFRENCH BY HER MOTHER HER PROFICIENCY IN EITHER WAS NOT REMARKABLE AND SHE SHIRKED HER LESSONS IN BOTH WHENEVER SHE COULD WHAT A STRANGE UNACCOUNTABLE CHARACTER FOR WITH ALL THESE SYMPTOMS OF PROFLIGACY AT TEN YEARS OLDHATED CONFINEMENT AND CLEANLINESS AND LOVED NOTHING SO WELL IN THE WORLD AS ROLLING DOWN THE GREEN SLOPE AT THE BACK OF THE HOUSE SUCH WAS CATHERINE MORLAND AT TEN AT FIFTEEN APPEARANCES WERE MENDINGSHE BEGAN TO CURL HER HAIR AND LONG FOR BALLS HER COMPLEXION IMPROVED HER FEATURES WERE SOFTENED BY PLUMPNESS AND COLOUR HER EYES GAINED MORE ANIMATION AND HER FIGURE MORE CONSEQUENCEHER LOVE OF DIRT GAVE WAY TO AN INCLINATION FOR FINERY AND SHE GREW CLEAN AS SHE GREW SMART SHE HAD NOW THE PLEASURE OF SOMETIMES HEARING HER FATHER AND MOTHER REMARK ON HER PERSONAL IMPROVEMENTCATHERINE GROWS QUITE A GOOD LOOKING GIRL SHE IS ALMOST PRETTY TODAY WERE WORDS WHICH CAUGHT HER EARS NOW AND THEN AND HOW WELCOME WERE THE SOUNDS TO LOOK ALMOST PRETTYTHAN A BEAUTY FROM HER CRADLE CAN EVER RECEIVE MISSUS MORLAND WAS A VERY GOOD WOMAN AND WISHED TO SEE HER CHILDREN EVERYTHING THEY OUGHT TO BE BUT HER TIME WAS SO MUCH OCCUPIED IN LYING IN AND TEACHING THE LITTLE ONESTHAT HER ELDER DAUGHTERS WERE INEVITABLY LEFT TO SHIFT FOR THEMSELVES AND IT WAS NOT VERY WONDERFUL THAT CATHERINE WHO HAD BY NATURE NOTHING HEROIC ABOUT HER SHOULD PREFER CRICKET BASEBALL RIDING ON HORSEBACKAND RUNNING ABOUT THE COUNTRY AT THE AGE OF FOURTEEN TO BOOKS OR AT LEAST BOOKS OF INFORMATION FOR PROVIDED THAT NOTHING LIKE USEFUL KNOWLEDGE COULD BE GAINED FROM THEM PROVIDED THEY WERE ALL STORY AND NO REFLECTIONSHE HAD NEVER ANY OBJECTION TO BOOKS AT ALL BUT FROM FIFTEEN TO SEVENTEEN SHE WAS IN TRAINING FOR A HEROINE SHE READ ALL SUCH WORKS AS HEROINES MUST READ TO SUPPLY THEIR MEMORIES WITH THOSE QUOTATIONS WHICH ARE SO SERVICEABLEMANY A FLOWER IS BORN TO BLUSH UNSEEN AND WASTE ITS FRAGRANCE ON THE DESERT AIR FROM THOMPSON THAT IT IS A DELIGHTFUL TASK TO TEACH THE YOUNG IDEA HOW TO SHOOTAND FROM SHAKESPEARE SHE GAINED A GREAT STORE OF INFORMATION AMONGST THE REST THAT TRIFLES LIGHT AS AIR ARE TO THE JEALOUS CONFIRMATION STRONG AS PROOFS OF HOLY WRITTHAT THE POOR BEETLE WHICH WE TREAD UPON IN CORPORAL SUFFERANCE FEELS A PANG AS GREAT AS WHEN A GIANT DIES AND THAT A YOUNG WOMAN IN LOVE ALWAYS LOOKSLIKE PATIENCE ON A MONUMENT SMILING AT GRIEF SO FAR HER IMPROVEMENT WAS SUFFICIENT AND IN MANY OTHER POINTS SHE CAME ON EXCEEDINGLY WELL FOR THOUGH SHE COULD NOT WRITE SONNETSSHE BROUGHT HERSELF TO READ THEM AND THOUGH THERE SEEMED NO CHANCE OF HER THROWING A WHOLE PARTY INTO RAPTURES BY A PRELUDE ON THE PIANOFORTE OF HER OWN COMPOSITION SHE COULD LISTEN TO OTHER PEOPLE'S PERFORMANCE WITH VERY LITTLE FATIGUEHER GREATEST DEFICIENCY WAS IN THE PENCIL SHE HAD NO NOTION OF DRAWING NOT ENOUGH EVEN TO ATTEMPT A SKETCH OF HER LOVER'S PROFILE THAT SHE MIGHT BE DETECTED IN THE DESIGNTHERE SHE FELL MISERABLY SHORT OF THE TRUE HEROIC HEIGHT AT PRESENT SHE DID NOT KNOW HER OWN POVERTY FOR SHE HAD NO LOVER TO PORTRAY SHE HAD REACHED THE AGE OF SEVENTEENWITHOUT HAVING SEEN ONE AMIABLE YOUTH WHO COULD CALL FORTH HER SENSIBILITY WITHOUT HAVING INSPIRED ONE REAL PASSION AND WITHOUT HAVING EXCITED EVEN ANY ADMIRATION BUT WHAT WAS VERY MODERATE AND VERY TRANSIENTTHIS WAS STRANGE INDEED BUT STRANGE THINGS MAY BE GENERALLY ACCOUNTED FOR IF THEIR CAUSE BE FAIRLY SEARCHED OUT THERE WAS NOT ONE LORD IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD NO NOT EVEN A BARONETTHERE WAS NOT ONE FAMILY AMONG THEIR ACQUAINTANCE WHO HAD REARED AND SUPPORTED A BOY ACCIDENTALLY FOUND AT THEIR DOOR NOT ONE YOUNG MAN WHOSE ORIGIN WAS UNKNOWN HER FATHER HAD NO WARD AND THE SQUIRE OF THE PARISH NO CHILDRENBUT WHEN A YOUNG LADY IS TO BE A HEROINE THE PERVERSENESS OF FORTY SURROUNDING FAMILIES CANNOT PREVENT HER SOMETHING MUST AND WILL HAPPEN TO THROW A HERO IN HER WAY MISTER ALLENWHO OWNED THE CHIEF OF THE PROPERTY ABOUT FULLERTON THE VILLAGE IN WILTSHIRE WHERE THE MORLANDS LIVED WAS ORDERED TO BATH FOR THE BENEFIT OF A GOUTY CONSTITUTION AND HIS LADY A GOOD HUMOURED WOMAN FOND OF MISS MORLAND AND PROBABLY AWARE THAT IFSHE MUST SEEK THEM ABROAD INVITED HER TO GO WITH THEMTHEY UNTIED IT AND LED IT AWAY SOME OF THEM PUT THEIR CLOTHES ON

THE TABLES WHERE THE MONEY WASWHEN THE MEN JUMPED UP FROM THEIR CHAIRS HE DROVE THEM OUT OF THE TEMPLE THEN HE DROVE THE SHEEP AND THE CATTLE OUT AFTER THE MEN IT IS WRITTEN IN THE SCRIPTURES GOD'S HOUSE SHALL BE A HOUSE OF PRAYERBUT YOU HAVE MADE IT INTO A DEN OF THIEVES AND ROBBERS HE CRIED THIS WAS TOO MUCH FOR THE PRIESTS OF THE TEMPLE AND ALL THE IMPORTANT MEN WHO RULED JERUSALEM THE NEXT DAY SOME OF THE RULERS CAME TO JESUS AND SAIDWHAT RIGHT HAVE YOU TO DO THESE THINGS WHO TOLD YOU THAT YOU COULD ACT LIKE THIS SO FAR JESUS HAD NEVER SAID THAT HE WAS THE MESSIAHBUT JESUS WAS TOO QUICK FOR THEM HE SAID I'LL ANSWER YOUR QUESTION IF YOU ANSWER A QUESTION OF MINE WHEN JOHN THE BAPTIST USED TO PREACH TO YOU AND BAPTIZE PEOPLE WHO GAVE HIM THE RIGHT TO DO THATTHEN THE RULERS DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO SAY THEY THOUGHT TO THEMSELVES NOW IF WE SAY THAT JOHN WAS SENT BY GOD TO PREACH HE WILL SAY WHY DIDN'T YOU LISTEN TO HIM THEN IF WE SAY THAT JOHN DIDN'T HAVE ANY RIGHT TO PREACHNEITHER AM I GOING TO TELL YOU WHAT RIGHT I HAVE TO DO THESE THINGS EVERY DAY THAT WEEK JESUS CAME AND TAUGHT IN THE TEMPLE SEVERAL TIMES HIS ENEMIES TRIED TO TRICK HIM INTO SAYING SOMETHING THAT WOULD TURN THE PEOPLE AGAINST HIMBUT JESUS ALWAYS HAD AN ANSWER WHICH SILENCED THEM ONCE THEY CAME AND ASKED SHOULD WE PAY TAXES TO THE ROMANS THAT WAS A HARD QUESTIONEVERYBODY WOULD HATE HIM TOO BUT IF HE SAID THEY

WOULD SEEM TO INDICATE THAT ALREADY IN LITTLE MORE THAN A CENTURY SINCE THE INTERDICT HAD FALLEN ON IT THE EDIFICES WHICH MADE SO FINE A SHOW IN THE DAYS OF PATRICK WERE RUINED AND UNINHABITABLESO

PRETTY SOON WOULDN'T THEYTHERE SEEM TO BE TOO MANY BASIC FACTORS MISSING IT MIGHT BE NECESSARY TO DEVELOP A WHOLE NEW CLASS OF SCIENCES FIRST AND THAT COULD TAKE A FEW CENTURIES WELL TRIGGER ADMITTED I COULD GET ALONG WITHOUT THE THINGS INDEFINITELYSAME HERE THE PLASMOID NABOB AGREED UNGRATEFULLY WEIRD BEASTIES BUT LET'S SEE AT PRESENT THERE ARE TWELVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY EIGHT MEMBER WORLDS TO THE

HAD A SECURITY CHIEF IN ON THAT FIRST OPERATIONRIGHT THERE ON HARVEST MOON THEY DID HE SAID IT WAS FAYLEHOLATI COULD THOSE THINGS EVER BECOME AS VALUABLE AS PEOPLE KEEP SAYING IT'S ALL SOUNDED A LITTLE EXAGGERATED TO ME THE COMMISSIONER SAID HE'D WONDERED ABOUT IT TOOI'M NOT ENOUGH OF A BIOLOGIST TO MAKE AN EDUCATED GUESS WHAT IT SEEMS TO BOIL DOWN TO IS THAT THEY MIGHT WHICH WOULD BE ENOUGH TO TEMPT A LOT OF PEOPLE TO GAMBLE VERY HIGH FOR A CHANCE TO GET CONTROL OF THE PLASMOID PROCESSAND WE KNOW DEFINITELY THAT SOME PEOPLE ARE GAMBLING FOR IT HOW DO YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN WORKING A COUPLE OF LEADS HERE PRETTY SHORT LEADS SO FAR BUT YOU WORK WITH WHAT YOU CAN GET HE NODDED AT THE TABLETRIGGER GLANCED DOWN THE PLASMOID LAY THERE SOME INCHES FROM THE SIDE OF HER HAND YOU KNOW SHE SAID

REPULSIVE STOOD UP FOR HIS RIGHTS EH MANTELISH GAINED SOME SUCH IMPRESSION ANYWAY HE BECAME MORE CAUTIOUS WITH IT AFTER THAT AND THEN HE LEARNED SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE IMPORTANTHE WAS VISITING ANOTHER LAB WHERE THEY HAD A COUPLE OF PLASMOIDS WHICH ACTUALLY MOVED NOW AND THENTHE TWO LAB PLASMOIDS STOPPED MOVING WHILE HE WAS THERE THEY HAVEN'T MOVED SINCERIGHT HE THOUGHT ABOUT THAT AND THEN LOCATED ANOTHER MOVING PLASMOIDTHE BIG ONE INDUCES PLASMOID ACTIVITY THE LITTLE ONE MODIFIES ITBUT HIS TWO LAB GUARDS AND ONE OF THE RAIDERS WERE KILLED THE OTHERS GOT AWAY GESS FAYLE'S DEFECTION WAS

INFORMATION EVEN IF THEY HAD GOT HIM ALIVE THE OTHER ITEM THEY DREW FROM HIS BRAIN WAS A CLEAR IMPRESSION OF THE TARGET OF THE RAID THE PROFESSOR'S PAL HERE UH HUH TRIGGER SAID LOST IN THOUGHTSHE POKED REPULSIVE LIGHTLY THAT WOULD BE FAYLE AND HIS ASSOCIATES THEN OR SOMEBODY WHO KNEW ABOUT THEM DID THEY WANT TO KILL IT OR GRAB IT THE COMMISSIONER LOOKED AT HER GRAB IT WAS THE DEAD BRAIN REPORT WHYSO THEY NEED IT IN CONNECTION WITH THE KEY UNIT TRIGGER ASKED PROBABLY THAT MAKES EVERYTHING LOOK VERY MUCH BETTER DOESN'T IT QUITE A LITTLE HE SAID THE UNIT MAY NOT WORKMANTELISH TALKS OF SOMETHING HE CALLS PROXIMITY INFLUENCESO TRIGGER SAID THEY MIGHT HAVE TWO THIRDS OF WHAT EVERYBODY WANTS AND YOU MIGHT HAVE ONE THIRD RIGHT HERE ON THE TABLE HOW MANY OF THE LATER RAIDERS DID YOU CATCH ALL OF THEM SAID THE COMMISSIONER AROUND FORTYWE GOT THEM DEAD WE GOT THEM ALIVE IT DIDN'T MAKE MUCH DIFFERENCE THEY WERE HIRED HANDS VERY EXPENSIVE HIRED HANDS BUT STILL JUST THAT MOST OF THEM DIDN'T KNOW A THING WE COULD USE THE ONES THAT DID KNOW SOMETHING WERE MIND BLOCKED AGAINI THOUGHT TRIGGER SAID REFLECTIVELY YOU COULD UN BLOCK SOMEONE LIKE THAT YOU CAN SOMETIMES IF YOU'RE VERY GOOD AT IT AND IF YOU HAVE TIME ENOUGH WE COULDN'T AFFORD TO WAIT A YEAR THEY DIED BEFORE THEY COULD TELL US ANYTHINGTHERE WAS A PAUSE THEN TRIGGER ASKED HOW DID YOU GET INVOLVED IN THIS PERSONALLY MORE OR LESS BY ACCIDENT THE COMMISSIONER SAID IT WAS IN CONNECTION WITH OUR SECOND LEAD THAT'S ME HUH SHE SAID UNHAPPILY YESWHY WOULD ANYONE WANT TO GRAB ME I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING HE SHOOK HIS HEAD WE HAVEN'T FOUND OUT YET WE'RE HOPING WE WILL IN A VERY FEW DAYS IS THAT ONE OF THE THINGS YOU CAN'T TELL ME ABOUTI CAN TELL YOU MOST OF WHAT I KNOW AT THE MOMENT SAID THE COMMISSIONERWE WILL PASS TO THE CONSIDERATION OF A REGULAR OUT AND OUT PIRATE ONE FROM WHOSE MAST HEAD WOULD HAVE FLOATED THE BLACK FLAG WITH ITS SKULL AND CROSS BONES IF THAT EMBLEMATIC PIECE OF BUNTING HAD BEEN IN USE BY THE PIRATES OF THE PERIODAND HIS OWN WAS UNKNOWN AND THE BRAZILIAN BECAUSE HE WAS BORN IN BRAZIL THOUGH OF DUTCH PARENTS UNLIKE MOST OF HIS FELLOW PRACTITIONERS HE DID NOT GRADUALLY BECOME A PIRATE FROM HIS EARLY YOUTHHE NEVER HAD AN INTENTION OF BEING ANYTHING ELSE AS SOON AS HE GREW TO BE A MAN HE BECAME A BLOODY BUCCANEER AND AT THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY HE JOINED A PIRATE CREW AND HAD MADE BUT A FEW VOYAGES WHEN IT WAS PERCEIVED BY HIS COMPANIONSTHAT HE WAS DESTINED TO BECOME A MOST REMARKABLE SEA ROBBER HE WAS OFFERED THE COMMAND OF A SHIP WITH A WELL ARMED CREW OF MARINE SAVAGESHE FELL IN WITH A SPANISH SHIP LOADED WITH SILVER BULLION HAVING CAPTURED THIS HE SAILED WITH HIS PRIZE TO JAMAICA WHICH WAS ONE OF THE GREAT RESORTS OF THE ENGLISH BUCCANEERS THERE HIS SUCCESS DELIGHTED THE COMMUNITYHIS TALENTS FOR THE CONDUCT OF GREAT PIRATICAL OPERATIONS SOON BECAME APPARENT AND HE WAS GENERALLY ACKNOWLEDGED AS THE HEAD PIRATE OF THE WEST INDIES HE WAS NOW LOOKED UPON AS A HERO EVEN BY THOSE COLONISTSWHO HAD NO SYMPATHY WITH PIRATES AND AS FOR ESQUEMELING HE SIMPLY WORSHIPPED THE GREAT BRAZILIAN DESPERADO IF HE HAD BEEN WRITING THE LIFE AND TIMES OF ALEXANDER THE GREAT JULIUS CAESAR OR MISTER GLADSTONEHE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE ENTHUSIASTIC IN HIS PRAISES AND AS IN THE ARABIAN NIGHTS THE ROC IS DESCRIBED AS THE GREATEST OF BIRDS SO IN THE EYES OF THE BUCCANEER BIOGRAPHER THIS ROC WAS THE GREATEST OF PIRATESTHAT ROC NOW BECAME FAMOUS THE BETTER HE BECAME KNOWN THE MORE GENERAL WAS THE FEAR AND RESPECT FELT FOR HIM AND WE ARE TOLD THAT THE MOTHERS OF THE ISLANDS USED TO PUT THEIR CHILDREN TO SLEEP BY THREATENING THEM WITH THE TERRIBLE ROC IF THEY DID NOT CLOSE THEIR EYESTHIS STORY HOWEVER I REGARD WITH A GREAT DEAL OF DOUBTBUT I DO NOT BELIEVE IT IS AN EASY THING TO FRIGHTEN A CHILD INTO GOING TO SLEEP IF I FOUND IT NECESSARY TO MAKE A YOUNGSTER TAKE A NAP I SHOULD SAY NOTHING OF THE CONDITION OF AFFAIRS IN CUBA OR OF THE PERSECUTIONS OF THE ARMENIANSTHIS RENOWNED PIRATE FROM BRAZIL MUST HAVE BEEN A TERRIBLE FELLOW TO LOOK AT HE WAS STRONG AND BRAWNY HIS FACE WAS SHORT AND VERY WIDE WITH HIGH CHEEK BONES AND HIS EXPRESSION PROBABLY RESEMBLED THAT OF A PUG DOGHIS EYEBROWS WERE ENORMOUSLY LARGE AND BUSHY AND FROM UNDER THEM HE GLARED AT HIS MUNDANE SURROUNDINGS HE WAS NOT A MAN WHOSE SPIRIT COULD BE QUELLED BY LOOKING HIM STEADFASTLY IN THE EYE IT WAS HIS CUSTOM IN THE DAYTIME TO WALK ABOUTCARRYING A DRAWN CUTLASS RESTING EASILY UPON HIS ARM EDGE UP VERY MUCH AS A FINE GENTLEMAN CARRIES HIS HIGH SILK HAT AND ANY ONE WHO SHOULD IMPERTINENTLY STARE OR ENDEAVOR TO QUELL HIS HIGH SPIRITS IN ANY OTHER WAYWOULD PROBABLY HAVE FELT THE EDGE OF THAT CUTLASS DESCENDING RAPIDLY THROUGH HIS PHYSICAL ORGANISM HE WAS A MAN WHO INSISTED UPON BEING OBEYED AND IF ANY ONE OF HIS CREW BEHAVED IMPROPERLY OR WAS EVEN FOUND IDLEBUT ALTHOUGH HE WAS SO STRICT AND EXACTING DURING THE BUSINESS SESSIONS OF HIS PIRATICAL YEAR BY WHICH I MEAN WHEN HE WAS CRUISING AROUND AFTER PRIZES HE WAS VERY MUCH MORE DISAGREEABLE WHEN HE WAS TAKING A VACATIONON HIS RETURN TO JAMAICA AFTER ONE OF HIS EXPEDITIONS IT WAS HIS HABIT TO GIVE HIMSELF SOME RELAXATION AFTER THE HARDSHIPS AND DANGERS THROUGH WHICH HE HAD PASSED AND ON SUCH OCCASIONS IT WAS A GREAT COMFORT TO ROC TO GET HIMSELF THOROUGHLY DRUNKWITH HIS CUTLASS WAVING HIGH IN THE AIR HE WOULD RUSH OUT INTO THE STREET AND TAKE A WHACK AT EVERY ONE WHOM HE MET AS FAR AS WAS POSSIBLE THE CITIZENS ALLOWED HIM TO HAVE THE STREET TO HIMSELF AND IT WAS NOT AT ALL LIKELYTHAT HIS VISITS TO JAMAICA WERE LOOKED FORWARD TO WITH ANY EAGER ANTICIPATIONS ROC IT MAY BE SAID WAS NOT ONLY A BLOODY PIRATE BUT A BLOODED ONE HE WAS THOROUGHBREDFROM THE TIME HE HAD BEEN ABLE TO ASSERT HIS INDIVIDUALITY HE HAD BEEN A PIRATE AND THERE WAS NO REASON TO SUPPOSE THAT HE WOULD EVER REFORM HIMSELF INTO ANYTHING ELSE THERE WERE NO EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES IN HIS CASEIN HIS NATURE THERE WAS NO ALLOY NOR MODERATION NOR FORBEARANCE THE APPRECIATIVE ESQUEMELING WHO MIGHT BE CALLED THE BOSWELL OF THE BUCCANEERS COULD NEVER HAVE MET HIS HERO ROCWHEN THAT BUSHY BEARDED PIRATE WAS RUNNING AMUCK IN THE STREETS BUT IF HE HAD IT IS NOT PROBABLE THAT HIS BOOK WOULD HAVE BEEN WRITTEN HE ASSURES US THAT WHEN ROC WAS NOT DRUNK HE WAS ESTEEMED BUT AT THE SAME TIME FEAREDBUT THERE ARE VARIOUS WAYS OF GAINING ESTEEM AND ROC'S METHOD CERTAINLY SUCCEEDED VERY WELL IN THE CASE OF HIS LITERARY ASSOCIATE AS WE HAVE SEEN THE HATRED OF THE SPANIARDS BY THE BUCCANEERS BEGAN VERY EARLY IN THE SETTLEMENT OF THE WEST INDIESBUT IN ALL THE INSTANCES OF FEROCIOUS ENMITY TOWARD THE SPANIARDS THERE HAS BEEN NOTHING TO EQUAL THE FEELINGS OF ROC THE BRAZILIAN UPON THAT SUBJECT HIS DISLIKE TO EVERYTHING SPANISH AROSE HE DECLAREDSEEMS TO HAVE BEEN THAT THERE WAS NOTHING TOO BAD FOR A SPANIARD THE OBJECT OF HIS LIFE WAS TO WAGE BITTER WAR AGAINST SPANISH SHIPS AND SPANISH SETTLEMENTS HE SELDOM GAVE ANY QUARTER TO HIS PRISONERSTHEN THERE WAS NOTHING FOR THEM TO DO BUT TO GO ON BOARD THEIR VESSELS AND PUT OUT TO SEA IN SEARCH OF SOME FRESH PRIZE SO FAR ROC'S CAREER HAD BEEN VERY MUCH LIKE THAT OF MANY OTHER COMPANIONS OF THE COASTDIFFERING FROM THEM ONLY IN RESPECT TO INTENSITY AND FORCE BUT HE WAS A CLEVER MAN WITH IDEASHE WAS CRUISING ABOUT CAMPEACHY WITHOUT SEEING ANY CRAFT THAT WAS WORTH CAPTURINGAND FIND OUT WHETHER OR NOT THERE WERE ANY SPANISH VESSELS IN THE BAY WHICH WERE WELL LADEN AND WHICH WERE LIKELY SOON TO COME OUT SO WITH A SMALL BOAT FILLED WITH SOME OF HIS TRUSTY MEN HE ROWED QUIETLY INTO THE PORT TO SEE WHAT HE COULD DISCOVERAND HAD SENT THAT MILD MANNERED OBSERVER INTO THE HARBOR TO INVESTIGATE INTO THE STATE OF AFFAIRSBUT HE CHOSE TO GO HIMSELF AND HE CAME TO GRIEF NO SOONER DID THE PEOPLE ON THE SHIPS LYING IN THE HARBOR BEHOLD A BOAT APPROACHING WITH A BIG BROWED BROAD JAWED MARINER SITTING IN THE STERNAND WITH A GOOD MANY MORE BROAD BACKED HAIRY MARINERS THAN WERE NECESSARY PULLING AT THE OARS THAN THEY GAVE THE ALARMROC MUST HAVE HAD A GREAT DEAL OF CONFIDENCE IN HIS OWN POWERS OR PERHAPS HE RELIED SOMEWHAT UPON THE FEAR WHICH HIS VERY PRESENCE EVOKED BUT HE MADE A MISTAKE THIS TIME HE HAD RUN INTO THE LION'S JAW AND THE LION HAD CLOSED HIS TEETH UPON HIMWHEN THE PIRATE CAPTAIN AND HIS COMPANIONS WERE BROUGHT BEFORE THE GOVERNOR HE MADE NO PRETENCE OF PUTTING THEM TO TRIAL BUCCANEERS WERE OUTLAWED BY THE SPANISHAND WERE CONSIDERED AS WILD BEASTS TO BE KILLED WITHOUT MERCY WHEREVER CAUGHT CONSEQUENTLY ROC AND HIS MEN WERE THROWN INTO A DUNGEON AND CONDEMNED TO BE EXECUTED IF HOWEVER THE SPANISH GOVERNOR HAD KNOWN WHAT WAS GOOD FOR HIMSELFDURING THE TIME THAT PREPARATIONS WERE GOING ON FOR MAKING EXAMPLES OF THESE IMPERTINENT PIRATESTHIS WAS A BRANCH OF THE BUSINESS IN WHICH A CAPABLE PIRATE WAS OBLIGED TO BE PROFICIENT IF HE COULD NOT GET HIMSELF OUT OF SCRAPES HE COULD NOT EXPECT TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN THIS CASE THERE WAS NO CHANCE OF CUTTING DOWN SENTINELSOR JUMPING OVERBOARD WITH A COUPLE OF WINE JARS FOR A LIFE PRESERVER OR OF DOING ANY OF THOSE ORDINARY THINGS WHICH PIRATES WERE IN THE HABIT OF DOING WHEN ESCAPING FROM THEIR CAPTORSINSIDE OF A FORTRESS AND IF THEY ESCAPED FROM THIS THEY WOULD FIND THEMSELVES UNARMED IN THE MIDST OF A BODY OF SPANISH SOLDIERS THEIR STOUT ARMS AND THEIR STOUT HEARTS WERE OF NO USE TO THEM NOWAND THEY WERE OBLIGED TO DEPEND UPON THEIR WITS IF THEY HAD ANY ROC HAD PLENTY OF WIT AND HE USED IT WELL THERE WAS A SLAVE PROBABLY NOT A NEGRO NOR A NATIVEWHO CAME IN TO BRING HIM FOOD AND DRINK AND BY THE MEANS OF THIS MAN THE PIRATE HOPED TO PLAY A TRICK UPON THE GOVERNOR HE PROMISED THE SLAVE THAT IF HE WOULD HELP HIM AND HE TOLD HIM IT WOULD BE VERY EASY TO DO SOHE WOULD GIVE HIM MONEY ENOUGH TO BUY HIS FREEDOM AND TO RETURN TO HIS FRIENDS AND THIS OF COURSE WAS A GREAT INDUCEMENT TO THE POOR FELLOW WHO MAY HAVE BEEN AN ENGLISHMAN OR A FRENCHMAN IN GOOD CIRCUMSTANCES AT HOME THE SLAVE AGREED TO THE PROPOSALSAND THE FIRST THING HE DID WAS TO BRING SOME WRITING MATERIALS TO ROC WHO THEREUPON BEGAN THE COMPOSITION OF A LETTERWHEN HE WAS COMING INTO THE BAY ROC HAD NOTICED A LARGE FRENCH VESSEL THAT WAS LYING AT SOME DISTANCE FROM THE TOWNBY THE HAND OF ROC WENT ON TO SAY THAT IF ANY HARM SHOULD COME TO THESE BRAVE MEN WHO HAD BEEN TAKEN AND IMPRISONED WHEN THEY WERE DOING NO HARM TO ANYBODY HE WOULD SWEAR IN HIS MOST SOLEMN MANNER THAT NEVERFOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE WOULD HE GIVE QUARTER TO ANY SPANIARD WHO MIGHT FALL INTO HIS HANDS AND HE MOREOVER THREATENED THAT ANY KIND OF VENGEANCE WHICH SHOULD BECOME POSSIBLE FOR THE BUCCANEERS AND FRENCH UNITED TO INFLICT UPON THE SPANISH SHIPSOR UPON THE TOWN OF CAMPEACHY SHOULD BE TAKEN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AFTER HE SHOULD HEAR OF ANY INJURY THAT MIGHT BE INFLICTED UPON THE UNFORTUNATE MEN WHO WERE THEN LYING IMPRISONED IN THE FORTRESS WHEN THE SLAVE CAME BACK TO ROCTHE LETTER WAS GIVEN TO HIM WITH VERY PARTICULAR DIRECTIONS AS TO WHAT HE WAS TO DO WITH IT HE WAS TO DISGUISE HIMSELF AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE SO THAT HE SHOULD NOT BE RECOGNIZED BY THE PEOPLE OF THE PLACE AND THEN IN THE NIGHT HE WAS TO MAKE HIS WAY OUT OF THE TOWNAND EARLY IN THE MORNING HE WAS TO RETURN AS IF HE HAD BEEN WALKING ALONG THE SHORE OF THE HARBOR WHEN HE WAS TO STATE THAT HE HAD BEEN PUT ON SHORE FROM THE FRENCH VESSEL IN THE OFFING WITH A LETTER WHICH HE WAS TO PRESENT TO THE GOVERNOR THE SLAVE PERFORMED HIS PART OF THE BUSINESS VERY WELLTHE NEXT DAY WET AND BEDRAGGLED FROM MAKING HIS WAY THROUGH THE WEEDS AND MUD OF THE COAST HE PRESENTED HIMSELF AT THE FORTRESS WITH HIS LETTER AND WHEN HE WAS ALLOWED TO TAKE IT TO THE GOVERNOR NO ONE SUSPECTED THAT HE WAS A PERSON EMPLOYED ABOUT THE PLACEHAVING FULFILLED HIS MISSION HE DEPARTED AND WHEN SEEN AGAIN HE WAS THE SAME SERVANT WHOSE BUSINESS IT WAS TO CARRY FOOD TO THE PRISONERS THE GOVERNOR READ THE LETTER WITH A DISQUIETED MINDHE KNEW THAT THE FRENCH SHIP WHICH WAS LYING OUTSIDE THE HARBOR WAS A POWERFUL VESSEL AND HE DID NOT LIKE FRENCH SHIPS ANYWAY THE TOWN HAD ONCE BEEN TAKEN AND VERY BADLY TREATED BY A LITTLE FLEET OF FRENCH AND ENGLISH BUCCANEERSAND HE WAS VERY ANXIOUS THAT NOTHING OF THE KIND SHOULD HAPPEN AGAIN THERE WAS NO GREAT SPANISH FORCE IN THE HARBOR AT THAT TIME AND HE DID NOT KNOW HOW MANY BUCCANEERING VESSELS MIGHT BE ABLE TO GATHER TOGETHER IN THE BAYIF IT SHOULD BECOME KNOWN THAT THE GREAT PIRATE ROC HAD BEEN PUT TO DEATH IN CAMPEACHY IT WAS AN UNUSUAL THING FOR A PRISONER TO HAVE SUCH POWERFUL FRIENDS SO NEAR BY AND THE GOVERNOR TOOK ROC'S CASE INTO MOST EARNEST CONSIDERATIONAND HE DETERMINED TO GET RID OF HIM AS SOON AS POSSIBLE HE FELT HIMSELF IN THE POSITION OF A MAN WHO HAS STOLEN A BABY BEAR AND WHO HEARS THE ROAR OF AN APPROACHING PARENT THROUGH THE WOODSTO THROW AWAY THE CUB AND WALK OFF AS THOUGH HE HAD NO IDEA THERE WERE ANY BEARS IN THAT FOREST WOULD BE THE INCLINATION OF A MAN SO SITUATED AND TO GET RID OF THE GREAT PIRATE WITHOUT PROVOKING THE VENGEANCE OF HIS FRIENDSWAS THE NATURAL INCLINATION OF THE GOVERNOR NOW ROC AND HIS MEN WERE TREATED WELL AND HAVING BEEN BROUGHT BEFORE THE GOVERNOR WERE TOLD THAT IN CONSEQUENCE OF THEIR HAVING COMMITTED NO OVERT ACT OF DISORDER THEY WOULD BE SET AT LIBERTY AND SHIPPED TO ENGLANDUPON THE SINGLE CONDITION THAT THEY WOULD ABANDON PIRACY AND AGREE TO BECOME QUIET CITIZENS IN WHATEVER RESPECTABLE VOCATION THEY MIGHT SELECT TO THESE TERMS ROC AND HIS MEN AGREED WITHOUT ARGUMENTTHEY DECLARED THAT THEY WOULD RETIRE FROM THE BUCCANEERING BUSINESS AND THAT NOTHING WOULD SUIT THEM BETTER THAN TO RETURN TO THE WAYS OF CIVILIZATION AND VIRTUE THERE WAS A SHIP ABOUT TO DEPART FOR SPAIN AND ON THIS THE GOVERNOR GAVE ROC AND HIS MEN FREE PASSAGE TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE OCEANTHERE IS NO DOUBT THAT OUR BUCCANEERS WOULD HAVE MUCH PREFERRED TO HAVE BEEN PUT ON BOARD THE FRENCH VESSEL BUT AS THE SPANISH GOVERNOR HAD STARTED HIS PRISONERS ON THE ROAD TO REFORM HE DID NOT WISH TO THROW THEM INTO THE WAY OF TEMPTATIONBY ALLOWING THEM TO ASSOCIATE WITH SUCH WICKED COMPANIONS AS FRENCHMEN AND ROC MADE NO SUGGESTION OF THE KIND KNOWING VERY WELL HOW GREATLY ASTONISHED THE FRENCH CAPTAIN WOULD BE IF THE GOVERNOR WERE TO COMMUNICATE WITH HIM ON THE SUBJECTON THE VOYAGE TO SPAIN ROC WAS ON HIS GOOD BEHAVIOR AND HE WAS A MAN WHO KNEW HOW TO BEHAVE VERY WELL WHEN IT WAS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY NO DOUBT THERE MUST HAVE BEEN MANY DULL DAYS ON BOARD SHIPWHEN HE WOULD HAVE BEEN DELIGHTED TO GAMBLE TO GET DRUNK AND TO RUN AMUCK UP AND DOWN THE DECK BUT HE CAREFULLY ABSTAINED FROM ALL THESE RECREATIONS AND SHOWED HIMSELF TO BE SUCH AN ABLE BODIED AND WILLING SAILORTHAT THE CAPTAIN ALLOWED HIM TO SERVE AS ONE OF THE CREW ROC KNEW HOW TO DO A GREAT MANY THINGS NOT ONLY COULD HE MURDER AND ROB BUT HE KNEW HOW TO TURN AN HONEST PENNY WHEN THERE WAS NO OTHER WAY OF FILLING HIS PURSE HE HAD LEARNED AMONG THE INDIANSHOW TO SHOOT FISH WITH BOW AND ARROWS AND ON THIS VOYAGE ACROSS THE ATLANTIC HE OCCUPIED ALL HIS SPARE TIME IN SITTING IN THE RIGGING AND SHOOTING THE FISH WHICH DISPORTED THEMSELVES ABOUT THE VESSELTHESE FISH HE SOLD TO THE OFFICERS AND WE ARE TOLD THAT IN THIS WAY HE EARNED NO LESS THAN FIVE HUNDRED CROWNS PERHAPS THAT MANY DOLLARS IF THIS ACCOUNT IS TRUE FISH MUST HAVE BEEN VERY COSTLY IN THOSE DAYSIN EVERY WAY ROC BEHAVED SO WELL THAT FOR HIS SAKE ALL HIS MEN WERE TREATED KINDLY AND ALLOWED MANY PRIVILEGES BUT WHEN THIS PARTY OF REFORMED PIRATES REACHED SPAIN AND WERE ALLOWED TO GO WHERE THEY PLEASEDTHEY THOUGHT NO MORE OF THE OATHS THEY HAD TAKEN TO ABANDON PIRACY THAN THEY THOUGHT OF THE OATHS WHICH THEY HAD BEEN IN THE HABIT OF THROWING RIGHT AND LEFTBUT AS SOON AS THEY COULD MANAGE IT THEY SAILED BACK TO THE WEST INDIES AND EVENTUALLY FOUND THEMSELVES IN JAMAICANOT ONLY DID ROC CAST FROM HIM EVERY THOUGHT OF REFORMATION AND A RESPECTABLE LIFE BUT HE DETERMINED TO BEGIN THE BUSINESS OF PIRACY ON A GRANDER SCALE THAN EVER BEFORE HE MADE A COMPACT WITH AN OLD FRENCH BUCCANEERAND WITH A LARGE COMPANY OF BUCCANEERS HE ACTUALLY SET OUT TO TAKE A TOWN HAVING LOST EVERYTHING HE POSSESSED AND HAVING PASSED SUCH A LONG TIME WITHOUT ANY EMPLOYMENT MORE PROFITABLE THAN THAT OF SHOOTING FISH WITH A BOW AND ARROWSOUR DOUGHTY PIRATE NOW DESIRED TO MAKE A GRAND STRIKE AND IF HE COULD TAKE A TOWN AND PILLAGE IT OF EVERYTHING VALUABLE IT CONTAINED HE WOULD MAKE A VERY GOOD FORTUNE IN A VERY SHORT TIME AND MIGHT RETIRE IF HE CHOSEFROM THE ACTIVE PRACTICE OF HIS PROFESSIONIN YUCATAN AND ALTHOUGH THIS WAS A BOLD AND RASH UNDERTAKING THE TWO PIRATES WERE BOLD AND RASH ENOUGH FOR ANYTHING ROC HAD BEEN A PRISONER IN MERIDA AND ON ACCOUNT OF HIS KNOWLEDGE OF THE TOWN HE BELIEVED THAT HE AND HIS FOLLOWERS COULD LAND UPON THE COASTIF THEY COULD DO THIS IT WOULD BE AN EASY MATTER TO RUSH UPON THE UNSUSPECTING GARRISON AND HAVING ANNIHILATED THESE MAKE THEMSELVES MASTERS OF THE TOWN BUT THEIR PLANS DID NOT WORK VERY WELL THEY WERE DISCOVERED BY SOME INDIANSAFTER THEY HAD LANDED WHO HURRIED TO MERIDA AND GAVE NOTICE OF THE APPROACH OF THE BUCCANEERS CONSEQUENTLY WHEN ROC AND HIS COMPANIONS REACHED THE TOWN THEY FOUND THE GARRISON PREPARED FOR THEM CANNONS LOADED AND ALL THE APPROACHES GUARDEDSTILL THE PIRATES DID NOT HESITATE THEY ADVANCED FIERCELY TO THE ATTACK JUST AS THEY WERE ACCUSTOMED TO DO WHEN THEY WERE BOARDING A SPANISH VESSEL BUT THEY SOON FOUND THAT FIGHTING ON LAND WAS VERY DIFFERENT FROM FIGHTING AT SEAIN A MARINE COMBAT IT IS SELDOM THAT A PARTY OF BOARDERS IS ATTACKED IN THE REAR BY THE ENEMY ALTHOUGH ON LAND SUCH METHODS OF WARFARE MAY ALWAYS BE EXPECTEDAND THEY WERE THEREFORE GREATLY DISMAYED WHEN A PARTY OF HORSEMEN FROM THE TOWN WHO HAD MADE A WIDE DETOUR THROUGH THE WOODS SUDDENLY CHARGED UPON THEIR REARTRIBUTOR AND A GREAT MANY OF THE PIRATES WERE KILLED OR TAKEN AND ROC THE BRAZILIAN HAD A TERRIBLE FALL THIS MOST MEMORABLE FALL OCCURRED IN THE ESTIMATION OF JOHN ESQUEMELINGWHO KNEW ALL ABOUT THE ATTACK ON MERIDA AND WHO WROTE THE ACCOUNT OF IT BUT HE HAD NEVER EXPECTED TO BE CALLED UPON TO RECORD THAT HIS GREAT HERO ROC THE BRAZILIAN SAVED HIS LIFE AFTER THE UTTER DEFEAT OF HIMSELF AND HIS COMPANIONSBY IGNOMINIOUSLY RUNNING AWAY THE LOYAL CHRONICLER HAD AS FIRM A BELIEF IN THE ABSOLUTE INABILITY OF HIS HERO TO FLY FROM DANGER AS WAS SHOWN BY THE SCOTTISH DOUGLAS WHEN HE STOODCOME ONE COME ALL THE BUSHY BROWED PIRATE OF THE DRAWN CUTLASSWHO WOULD EVEN SURRENDER TO SAY NOTHING OF RUNNING AWAY THAT ESQUEMELING COULD SCARCELY BELIEVE THAT ROC HAD RETREATED FROM HIS ENEMIES DESERTED HIS FRIENDS AND TURNED HIS BACK UPON THE PRINCIPLES WHICH HE HAD ALWAYS SO TRUCULENTLY PROCLAIMEDBUT THIS DOWNFALL OF A HERO SIMPLY SHOWS THAT ESQUEMELING ALTHOUGH HE WAS A MEMBER OF THE PIRATICAL BODY AND WAS PROUD TO CONSIDER HIMSELF A BUCCANEER DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE TRUE NATURE OF A PIRATE UNDER THE BRUTALITYTHE CRUELTY THE DISHONESTY AND THE RECKLESSNESS OF THE SEA ROBBERS OF THOSE DAYS THERE WAS NEARLY ALWAYS MEANNESS AND COWARDICE ROC AS WE HAVE SAID IN THE BEGINNING OF THIS SKETCH WAS A TYPICAL PIRATEUNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES HE SHOWED HIMSELF TO HAVE ALL THOSE BRAVE AND SAVAGE QUALITIES WHICH ESQUEMELING ESTEEMED AND REVERED AND UNDER OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES HE SHOWED THOSE OTHER QUALITIES WHICH ESQUEMELING DESPISEDBUT WHICH ARE NECESSARY TO MAKE UP THE TRUE CHARACTER OF A PIRATE THE HISTORIAN JOHN SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN VERY MUCH CUT UP BY THE MANNER IN WHICH HIS FAVORITE HERO HAD ROUNDED OFF HIS PIRATICAL CAREERAND AFTER THAT HE ENTIRELY DROPPED ROC FROM HIS CHRONICLESTHE FERNS DRENCHED HIS STIRRUPS AS HE BRUSHED THROUGH THEM AND EACH DRIPPING TREE TOP BROKE THE SUNLIGHT AND LET IT DROP IN TENT LIKE BEAMS THROUGH THE SHIMMERING UNDERMIST A BIRD FLASHED HERE AND THERE THROUGH THE GREEN GLOOMBUT THERE WAS NO SOUND IN THE AIR BUT THE FOOTFALLS OF HIS HORSE AND THE EASY CREAKING OF LEATHER UNDER HIM THE DRIP OF DEW OVERHEAD AND THE RUNNING OF WATER BELOW NOW AND THEN HE COULD SEE THE SAME SLENDER FOOT PRINTS IN THE RICH LOAMAND HE SAW THEM IN THE SAND WHERE THE FIRST TINY BROOK TINKLED ACROSS THE PATH FROM A GLOOMY RAVINE THERE THE LITTLE CREATURE HAD TAKEN A FLYING LEAP ACROSS IT AND BEYOND HE COULD SEE THE PRINTS NO MORE HE LITTLE GUESSED THAT WHILE HE HALTED TO LET HIS HORSE DRINKHE TURNED BACK UP THE CREEK AND PASSED SO CLOSE TO WHERE SHE HAD SLIPPED ASIDE INTO THE BUSHES THAT SHE CAME NEAR SHRIEKING BUT HIS EYES WERE FIXED ON A POOL OF THE CREEK ABOVE AND TO HER WONDER HE STROLLED STRAIGHT INTO THE WATER WITH HIS BOOTS ONPUSHING THE NET IN FRONT OF HIM HE WAS A RAIDER SURE SHE THOUGHT NOW AND HE WAS LOOKING FOR A MOONSHINE STILL AND THE WILD LITTLE THING IN THE BUSHES SMILED CUNNINGLY THERE WAS NO STILL UP THAT CREEKAND AS HE HAD LEFT HIS HORSE BELOW AND HIS GUN SHE WAITED FOR HIM TO COME BACK WHICH HE DID BY AND BY DRIPPING AND SOAKED TO HIS KNEES THEN SHE SAW HIM UNTIE THE QUEER GUN ON HIS SADDLE PULL IT OUT OF A CASE ANDHER EYES GOT BIG WITH WONDER TAKE IT TO PIECES AND MAKE IT INTO A LONG LIMBER ROD IN A MOMENT HE HAD CAST A MINNOW INTO THE POOL AND WADED OUT INTO THE WATER UP TO HIS HIPS SHE HAD NEVER SEEN SO QUEER A FISHING POLE SO QUEER A FISHERMANHOW COULD HE GET A FISH OUT WITH THAT LITTLE SWITCH SHE THOUGHT CONTEMPTUOUSLY BY AND BY SOMETHING HUMMED QUEERLY THE MAN GAVE A

UTTER A WORD SUCH DEFERENCE DID THEY PAY HIMCHAPTER FIFTEEN CHAMPION BUFFALO KILLER SHORTLY AFTER THE ADVENTURES MENTIONED IN THE PRECEDING CHAPTER I HAD MY CELEBRATED BUFFALO HUNT WITH BILLY COMSTOCK A NOTED SCOUT GUIDE AND INTERPRETERWHO WAS THEN CHIEF OF SCOUTS AT FORT WALLACE KANSAS COMSTOCK HAD THE REPUTATION FOR A LONG TIME OF BEING A MOST SUCCESSFUL BUFFALO HUNTER AND THE OFFICERS IN PARTICULAR WHO HAD SEEN HIM KILL BUFFALOES WERE VERY DESIROUS OF BACKING HIM IN A MATCH AGAINST MEIT WAS ACCORDINGLY ARRANGED THAT I SHOULD SHOOT HIM A BUFFALO KILLING MATCH AND THE PRELIMINARIES WERE EASILY AND SATISFACTORILY AGREED UPON WE WERE TO HUNT ONE DAY OF EIGHT HOURS BEGINNING AT EIGHT O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING AND CLOSING AT FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOONTHE WAGER WAS FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS A SIDE AND THE MAN WHO SHOULD KILL THE GREATER NUMBER OF BUFFALOES FROM ON HORSEBACK WAS TO BE DECLARED THE WINNER THE HUNT TOOK PLACE ABOUT TWENTY MILES EAST OF SHERIDAN AND AS IT HAD BEEN PRETTY WELL ADVERTISED AND NOISED ABROADA LARGE CROWD WITNESSED THE INTERESTING AND EXCITING SCENE AN EXCURSION PARTY MOSTLY FROM SAINT LOUIS CONSISTING OF ABOUT A HUNDRED GENTLEMEN AND LADIES CAME OUT ON A SPECIAL TRAIN TO VIEW THE SPORT AND AMONG THE NUMBER WAS MY WIFE WITH LITTLE BABY ARTATHE BUFFALOES WERE QUITE PLENTY AND IT WAS AGREED THAT WE SHOULD GO INTO THE SAME HERD AT THE SAME TIME AND MAKE A RUN AS WE CALLED IT EACH ONE KILLING AS MANY AS POSSIBLE A REFEREE WAS TO FOLLOW EACH OF US ON HORSEBACK WHEN WE ENTERED THE HERD AND COUNT THE BUFFALOES KILLED BY EACH MANWHEN THEY WERE TO COME UP AS NEAR AS THEY PLEASED AND WITNESS THE CHASE WE WERE FORTUNATE IN THE FIRST RUN IN GETTING GOOD GROUND COMSTOCK WAS MOUNTED ON ONE OF HIS FAVORITE HORSES WHILE I RODE OLD BRIGHAM I FELT CONFIDENT THAT I HAD THE ADVANTAGE OF COMSTOCK IN TWO THINGSFIRST I HAD THE BEST BUFFALO HORSE THAT EVER MADE A TRACK AND SECOND I WAS USING WHAT WAS KNOWN AT THAT TIME AS THE NEEDLE GUN A BREECH LOADING SPRINGFIELD RIFLE CALIBRE FIFTY IT WAS MY FAVORITE OLD LUCRETIA WHICH HAS ALREADY BEEN INTRODUCED TO THE NOTICE OF THE READERWHILE COMSTOCK WAS ARMED WITH A HENRY RIFLE AND ALTHOUGH HE COULD FIRE A FEW SHOTS QUICKER THAN I COULD YET I WAS PRETTY CERTAIN THAT IT DID NOT CARRY POWDER AND LEAD ENOUGH TO DO EXECUTION EQUAL TO MY CALIBRE FIFTY AT LAST THE TIME CAME TO BEGIN THE MATCHCOMSTOCK AND I DASHED INTO A HERD FOLLOWED BY THE REFEREES THE BUFFALOES SEPARATED COMSTOCK TOOK THE LEFT BUNCH AND I THE RIGHT MY GREAT FORTE IN KILLING BUFFALOES FROM HORSEBACK WAS TO GET THEM CIRCLING BY RIDING MY HORSE AT THE HEAD OF THE HERD SHOOTING THE LEADERSTILL THEY WOULD FINALLY CIRCLE ROUND AND ROUND ON THIS MORNING THE BUFFALOES WERE VERY ACCOMMODATINGI HAD NURSED MY BUFFALOES AS A BILLIARD PLAYER DOES THE BALLS WHEN HE MAKES A BIG RUN AFTER THE RESULT OF THE FIRST RUN HAD BEEN DULY ANNOUNCED OUR SAINT LOUIS EXCURSION FRIENDS WHO HAD APPROACHED TO THE PLACE WHERE WE HAD STOPPED SET OUT A LOT OF CHAMPAGNE WHICH THEY HAD BROUGHT WITH THEMAND WHICH PROVED A GOOD DRINK ON A KANSAS PRAIRIE AND A BUFFALO HUNTER WAS A GOOD MAN TO GET AWAY WITH IT WHILE TAKING A SHORT REST WE SUDDENLY SPIED ANOTHER HERD OF BUFFALOES COMING TOWARD US IT WAS ONLY A SMALL DROVE AND WE AT ONCE PREPARED TO GIVE THE ANIMALS A LIVELY RECEPTIONTHEY PROVED TO BE A HERD OF COWS AND CALVES WHICH BY THE WAY ARE QUICKER IN THEIR MOVEMENTS THAN THE BULLS WE CHARGED IN AMONG THEM AND I CONCLUDED MY RUN WITH A SCORE OF EIGHTEEN WHILE COMSTOCK KILLED FOURTEENWE CAME UP CLOSE TO ANOTHER HERD AS I WAS SO FAR AHEAD OF MY COMPETITOR IN THE NUMBER KILLED I THOUGHT I COULD AFFORD TO GIVE AN EXTRA EXHIBITION OF MY SKILL I HAD TOLD THE LADIES THAT I WOULD ON THE NEXT RUN RIDE MY HORSE WITHOUT SADDLE OR BRIDLEAND I REMEMBER ONE FAIR LADY WHO ENDEAVORED TO PREVAIL UPON ME NOT TO ATTEMPT IT THAT'S NOTHING AT ALL SAID I I HAVE DONE IT MANY A TIME AND OLD BRIGHAM KNOWS AS WELL AS I WHAT I AM DOING AND SOMETIMES A GREAT DEAL BETTER SO LEAVING MY SADDLE AND BRIDLE WITH THE WAGONSWE RODE TO THE WINDWARD OF THE BUFFALOES AS USUAL AND WHEN WITHIN A FEW HUNDRED YARDS OF THEM WE DASHED INTO THE HERD I SOON HAD THIRTEEN LAID OUT ON THE GROUND THE LAST ONE OF WHICH I HAD DRIVEN DOWN CLOSE TO THE WAGONS WHERE THE LADIES WEREIT FRIGHTENED SOME OF THE TENDER CREATURES TO SEE THE BUFFALO COMING AT FULL SPEED DIRECTLY TOWARD THEM BUT WHEN HE HAD GOT WITHIN FIFTY YARDS OF ONE OF THE WAGONS I SHOT HIM DEAD IN HIS TRACKS THIS MADE MY SIXTY NINTH BUFFALO AND FINISHED MY THIRD AND LAST RUNCOMSTOCK HAVING KILLED FORTY SIX AS IT WAS NOW LATE IN THE AFTERNOON COMSTOCK AND HIS BACKERS GAVE UP THE IDEA THAT HE COULD BEAT ME AND THEREUPON THE REFEREES DECLARED ME THE WINNER OF THE MATCHTHEY PREPARED TO DEPART HAVING DECLINED AN INVITATION TO PASS THE NIGHT THEREHAD ATTRACTED THE ATTENTION OF THE INDIANS WHO OVERTOOK HIM AND HIS COMPANION WHEN THEY HAD GONE ABOUT HALF A MILE AFTER SURROUNDING THE TWO MEN THEY SUDDENLY ATTACKED THEM THEY KILLED SCALPED AND ROBBED COMSTOCK BUT GROVER ALTHOUGH SEVERELY WOUNDED MADE HIS ESCAPEOWING TO THE FLEETNESS OF THE EXCELLENT HORSE WHICH HE WAS RIDING THIS SAD EVENT OCCURRED AUGUST TWENTY SEVENTH EIGHTEEN SIXTY EIGHT ON OUR WAY BACK TO CAMP WE TOOK WITH US SOME OF THE CHOICE MEAT AND FINEST HEADSIN THIS CONNECTION IT WILL NOT BE OUT OF PLACE TO STATE THAT DURING THE TIME I WAS HUNTING FOR THE KANSAS PACIFIC I ALWAYS BROUGHT INTO CAMP THE BEST BUFFALO HEADS AND TURNED THEM OVER TO THE COMPANY WHO FOUND A VERY GOOD USE FOR THEM THEY HAD THEM MOUNTED IN THE BEST POSSIBLE MANNERAND SENT THEM TO ALL THE PRINCIPAL CITIES AND RAILROAD CENTERS IN THE COUNTRY HAVING THEM PLACED IN PROMINENT POSITIONS AT THE LEADING HOTELS DEPOTS AND OTHER PUBLIC BUILDINGS AS A SORT OF TRADE MARK OR ADVERTISEMENT OF THE KANSAS PACIFIC RAILROADAND TO DAY THEY ATTRACT THE ATTENTION OF THE TRAVELER ALMOST EVERYWHERE WHENEVER I AM TRAVELING OVER THE COUNTRY AND SEE ONE OF THESE TRADE MARKS I FEEL PRETTY CERTAIN THAT I WAS THE CAUSE OF THE DEATH OF THE OLD FELLOW WHOSE BODY IT ONCE ORNAMENTEDMY SERVICES AS A HUNTER WERE NOT ANY LONGER REQUIRED AT THIS TIME THERE WAS A GENERAL INDIAN WAR RAGING ALL ALONG THE WESTERN BORDERS GENERAL SHERIDAN HAD TAKEN UP HIS HEADQUARTERS AT FORT HAYES IN ORDER TO BE IN THE FIELD TO SUPERINTEND THE CAMPAIGN IN PERSONAS SCOUTS AND GUIDES WERE IN GREAT DEMAND I CONCLUDED ONCE MORE TO TAKE UP MY OLD AVOCATION OF SCOUTING AND GUIDING FOR THE ARMY HAVING NO SUITABLE PLACE IN WHICH TO LEAVE MY OLD AND FAITHFUL BUFFALO HUNTER BRIGHAM AND NOT WISHING TO KILL HIM BY SCOUTINGI DETERMINED TO DISPOSE OF HIM I WAS VERY RELUCTANT TO PART WITH HIM BUT I CONSOLED MYSELF WITH THE THOUGHT THAT HE WOULD NOT BE LIKELY TO RECEIVE HARDER USAGE IN OTHER HANDS THAN HE HAD IN MINE I HAD SEVERAL GOOD OFFERS TO SELL HIMBUT AT THE SUGGESTION OF SOME GENTLEMEN IN SHERIDAN ALL OF WHOM WERE ANXIOUS TO OBTAIN POSSESSION OF THE HORSE I PUT HIM UP AT A RAFFLE IN ORDER TO GIVE THEM ALL AN EQUAL CHANCE OF BECOMING THE OWNER OF THE FAMOUS STEED THERE WERE TEN CHANCES AT THIRTY DOLLARS EACH AND THEY WERE ALL QUICKLY TAKENA PURSE OF TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS WAS MADE UP TO BE GIVEN TO THE HORSE THAT COULD FIRST REACH WYANDOTTE FOUR MILES DISTANT THE ARRANGEMENT WAS CARRIED OUT AND BRIGHAM WAS ENTERED AS ONE OF THE CONTESTANTS FOR THE PURSEEVERYBODY LAUGHED AT MISTER

GIVEN AND OFF WENT THE HORSES FOR WYANDOTTEFOR THE FIRST HALF MILE SEVERAL OF THE HORSES LED BRIGHAM BUT ON THE SECOND MILE HE BEGAN PASSING THEM ONE AFTER THE OTHER AND ON THE THIRD MILE HE WAS IN ADVANCE OF THEM ALL AND WAS SHOWING THEM ALL THE ROAD AT A LIVELY RATE ON THE FOURTH MILE HIS RIDER LET HIM OUTAND ARRIVED AT THE HOTEL THE HOME STATION IN WYANDOTTE A LONG WAY AHEAD OF HIS FASTEST COMPETITOR EVERYBODY WAS SURPRISED AS WELL AS DISGUSTED THAT SUCH A HOMELY CRITTER SHOULD BE THE WINNER BRIGHAM OF COURSE HAD ALREADY ACQUIRED A WIDE REPUTATIONAND HIS NAME AND EXPLOITS HAD OFTEN APPEARED IN THE NEWSPAPERS AND WHEN IT WAS LEARNED THAT THIS CRITTER WAS NONE OTHER THAN THE IDENTICAL BUFFALO HUNTING BRIGHAM NEARLY THE WHOLE CROWD ADMITTED THAT THEY HAD HEARD OF HIM BEFORE AND HAD THEY KNOWN HIM IN THE FIRST PLACE THEY CERTAINLY WOULD HAVE RULED HIM OUTI FINALLY LOST TRACK OF BRIGHAM AND FOR SEVERAL YEARS I DID NOT KNOW WHAT HAD BECOME OF HIM THREE YEARS AGO WHILE I WAS AT MEMPHIS TENNESSEE I MET A MISTER WILCOX WHO HAD BEEN ONE OF THE SUPERINTENDENTS OF CONSTRUCTION OF THE KANSAS PACIFIC RAILROAD AND HE INFORMED ME THAT HE OWNED BRIGHAMONLY A FEW MILES OUT OF TOWN THE NEXT DAY I RODE OUT WITH MISTER WILCOX AND TOOK A LOOK AT THE GALLANT OLD HORSE HE WAS COMFORTABLY CARED FOR IN MISTER WILCOX'S STABLE AND LOOKED THE SAME CLEVER PONY THAT HE ALWAYS WAS IT SEEMED AS

AT HIS LIPS IN AN ATTITUDE THAT WAS AT ONCE LUDICROUS AND HORRIBLEHE HAD COME SUDDENLY UPON HER AS HE TURNED INTO THE AVENUE AND HIS HEART HAD LEAPED UP AT THE SIGHT OF HER HE WALKED ALONG BY HER NOW REJOICING AFTER ALL IN A LITTLE MOMENT OF THIS EARTHLY LOVE HE COULD NOT DRIVE OUT OF HIS LIFE I HAVE JUST BEEN OVER TO SEE VIRGINIASAID RACHEL SHE TELLS ME THE ARRANGEMENTS ARE NEARLY COMPLETED FOR

PROFESSIONAL SLUM WORKERS SHE HAS BEEN SPENDING NEARLY ALL SUMMER IN GETTING INFORMATION ROLLIN WAS BEGINNING TO FEEL MORE AT EASE AS THEY TALKED OVER THIS COMING WORK OF HUMANITY IT WAS SAFE COMMON GROUNDWHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DOING ALL SUMMER I HAVE NOT SEEN MUCH OF YOU RACHEL SUDDENLY ASKED AND THEN HER FACE WARMED WITH ITS QUICK FLUSH OF TROPICAL COLOR AS IF SHE MIGHT HAVE IMPLIED TOO MUCH INTEREST IN ROLLIN OR TOO MUCH REGRET AT NOT SEEING HIM OFTENERI HAVE BEEN BUSY REPLIED ROLLIN BRIEFLY TELL ME SOMETHING ABOUT IT PERSISTED RACHEL YOU SAY SO LITTLESHE PUT THE QUESTION VERY FRANKLY TURNING TOWARD ROLLIN IN REAL EARNEST YES CERTAINLY HE REPLIED WITH A GRACEFUL SMILE I AM NOT SO CERTAIN THAT I CAN TELL YOU MUCHI HAVE BEEN TRYING TO FIND SOME WAY TO REACH THE MEN I ONCE KNEW AND WIN THEM INTO MORE USEFUL LIVES HE STOPPED SUDDENLY AS IF HE WERE ALMOST AFRAID TO GO ON RACHEL DID NOT VENTURE TO SUGGEST ANYTHINGI HAVE BEEN A MEMBER OF THE SAME COMPANY TO WHICH YOU AND VIRGINIA BELONG CONTINUED ROLLIN BEGINNING AGAIN I HAVE MADE THE PLEDGE TO DO AS I BELIEVE JESUS WOULD DOAND IT IS IN TRYING TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION THAT I HAVE BEEN DOING MY WORK THAT IS WHAT I DO NOT UNDERSTAND VIRGINIA TOLD ME ABOUT THE OTHER IT SEEMS WONDERFUL TO THINK THAT YOU ARE TRYING TO KEEP THAT PLEDGE WITH US BUT WHAT CAN YOU DO WITH THE CLUB MENYOU HAVE ASKED ME A DIRECT QUESTION AND I SHALL HAVE TO ANSWER IT NOW REPLIED ROLLIN SMILING AGAIN YOU SEE I ASKED MYSELF AFTER THAT NIGHT AT THE TENT YOU REMEMBER HE SPOKE HURRIEDLY AND HIS VOICE TREMBLED A LITTLEWHAT PURPOSE I COULD NOW HAVE IN MY LIFE TO REDEEM IT TO SATISFY MY THOUGHT OF CHRISTIAN DISCIPLESHIP AND THE MORE I THOUGHT OF IT THE MORE I WAS DRIVEN TO A PLACE WHERE I KNEW I MUST TAKE UP THE CROSSDID YOU EVER THINK THAT OF ALL THE NEGLECTED BEINGS IN OUR SOCIAL SYSTEM NONE ARE QUITE SO COMPLETELY LEFT ALONE AS THE FAST YOUNG MEN WHO FILL THE CLUBS AND WASTE THEIR TIME AND MONEY AS I USED TOTHE CHURCHES LOOK AFTER THE POOR MISERABLE CREATURES LIKE THOSE IN THE RECTANGLE THEY MAKE SOME EFFORT TO REACH THE WORKING MAN THEY HAVE A LARGE CONSTITUENCY AMONG THE AVERAGE SALARY EARNING PEOPLE THEY SEND MONEY AND MISSIONARIES TO THE FOREIGN HEATHENBUT THE FASHIONABLE DISSIPATED YOUNG MEN AROUND TOWN THE CLUB MEN ARE LEFT OUT OF ALL PLANS FOR REACHING AND CHRISTIANIZING AND YET NO CLASS OF PEOPLE NEED IT MORE I SAID TO MYSELF I KNOW THESE MEN THEIR GOOD AND THEIR BAD QUALITIES I HAVE BEEN ONE OF THEMI AM NOT FITTED TO REACH THE RECTANGLE PEOPLE I DO NOT KNOW HOW BUT I THINK I COULD POSSIBLY REACH SOME OF THE YOUNG MEN AND BOYS WHO HAVE MONEY AND TIME TO SPEND SO THAT IS WHAT I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO DOWHEN I ASKED AS YOU DID WHAT WOULD JESUS DO THAT WAS MY ANSWERROLLIN'S VOICE WAS SO LOW ON THIS LAST SENTENCE THAT RACHEL HAD DIFFICULTY IN HEARING HIM ABOVE THE NOISE AROUND THEM BUT SHE KNEW WHAT HE HAD SAID SHE WANTED TO ASK WHAT HIS METHODS WERE BUT SHE DID NOT KNOW HOW TO ASK HIMHER INTEREST IN HIS PLAN WAS LARGER THAN MERE CURIOSITY ROLLIN PAGE WAS SO DIFFERENT NOW FROM THE FASHIONABLE YOUNG MAN WHO HAD ASKED HER TO BE HIS WIFE THAT SHE COULD NOT HELP THINKING OF HIM AND TALKING WITH HIM AS IF HE WERE AN ENTIRELY NEW ACQUAINTANCETHEY HAD TURNED OFF THE AVENUE AND WERE GOING UP THE STREET TO RACHEL'S HOME IT WAS THE SAME STREET WHERE ROLLIN HAD ASKED RACHEL WHY SHE COULD NOT LOVE HIM THEY WERE BOTH STRICKEN WITH A SUDDEN SHYNESS AS THEY WENT ONRACHEL HAD NOT FORGOTTEN THAT DAY AND ROLLIN COULD NOT SHE FINALLY BROKE A LONG SILENCE BY ASKING WHAT SHE HAD NOT FOUND WORDS FOR BEFOREIN YOUR WORK WITH THE CLUB MEN WITH YOUR OLD ACQUAINTANCES WHAT SORT OF RECEPTION DO THEY GIVE YOU HOW DO YOU APPROACH THEM WHAT DO THEY SAY ROLLIN WAS RELIEVED WHEN RACHEL SPOKE HE ANSWERED QUICKLY OH IT DEPENDS ON THE MANA GOOD MANY OF THEM THINK I AM A CRANK I HAVE KEPT MY MEMBERSHIP UP AND AM IN GOOD STANDING IN THAT WAY I TRY TO BE WISE AND NOT PROVOKE ANY UNNECESSARY CRITICISM BUT YOU WOULD BE SURPRISED TO KNOW HOW MANY OF THE MEN HAVE RESPONDED TO MY APPEALI COULD HARDLY MAKE YOU BELIEVE THAT ONLY A FEW NIGHTS AGO A DOZEN MEN BECAME HONESTLY AND EARNESTLY ENGAGED IN A CONVERSATION OVER RELIGIOUS MATTERS I HAVE HAD THE GREAT JOY OF SEEING SOME OF THE MEN GIVE UP BAD HABITS AND BEGIN A NEW LIFEWHAT WOULD JESUS DO I KEEP ASKING IT THE ANSWER COMES SLOWLY FOR I AM FEELING MY WAY SLOWLY ONE THING I HAVE FOUND OUT THE MEN ARE NOT FIGHTING SHY OF ME I THINK THAT IS A GOOD SIGNANOTHER THING I HAVE ACTUALLY INTERESTED SOME OF THEM IN THE RECTANGLE WORK AND WHEN IT IS STARTED UP THEY WILL GIVE SOMETHING TO HELP MAKE IT MORE POWERFUL AND IN ADDITION TO ALL THE REST I HAVE FOUND A WAY TO SAVE SEVERAL OF THE YOUNG FELLOWS FROM GOING TO THE BAD IN GAMBLINGROLLIN SPOKE WITH ENTHUSIASM HIS FACE WAS TRANSFORMED BY HIS INTEREST IN THE SUBJECT WHICH HAD NOW BECOME A PART OF HIS REAL LIFE RACHEL AGAIN NOTED THE STRONG MANLY TONE OF HIS SPEECHWITH IT ALL SHE KNEW THERE WAS A DEEP UNDERLYING SERIOUSNESS WHICH FELT THE BURDEN OF THE CROSS EVEN WHILE CARRYING IT WITH JOY THE NEXT TIME SHE SPOKE IT WAS WITH A SWIFT FEELING OF JUSTICE DUE TO ROLLIN AND HIS NEW LIFEDO YOU REMEMBER I REPROACHED YOU ONCE FOR NOT HAVING ANY PURPOSE WORTH LIVING FOR SHE ASKED WHILE HER BEAUTIFUL FACE SEEMED TO ROLLIN MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN EVER WHEN HE HAD WON SUFFICIENT SELF CONTROL TO LOOK UP I WANT TO SAYI FEEL THE NEED OF SAYING IN JUSTICE TO YOU NOW THAT I HONOR YOU FOR YOUR COURAGE AND YOUR OBEDIENCE TO THE PROMISE YOU HAVE MADE AS YOU INTERPRET THE PROMISE THE LIFE YOU ARE LIVING IS A NOBLE ONE ROLLIN TREMBLED HIS AGITATION WAS GREATER THAN HE COULD CONTROLRACHEL COULD NOT HELP SEEING IT THEY WALKED ALONG IN SILENCE AT LAST ROLLIN SAID I THANK YOU IT HAS BEEN WORTH MORE TO ME THAN I CAN TELL YOU TO HEAR YOU SAY THAT HE LOOKED INTO HER FACE FOR ONE MOMENTSHE READ HIS LOVE FOR HER IN THAT LOOK BUT HE DID NOT SPEAK WHEN THEY SEPARATED RACHEL WENT INTO THE HOUSE AND SITTING DOWN IN HER ROOM SHE PUT HER FACE IN HER HANDS AND SAID TO HERSELFI AM BEGINNING TO KNOW WHAT IT MEANS TO BE LOVED BY A NOBLE MAN I SHALL LOVE ROLLIN PAGE AFTER ALL WHAT AM I SAYING RACHEL WINSLOW HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN SHE ROSE AND WALKED BACK AND FORTH SHE WAS DEEPLY MOVEDNEVERTHELESS IT WAS EVIDENT TO HERSELF THAT HER EMOTION WAS NOT THAT OF REGRET OR SORROW SOMEHOW A GLAD NEW JOY HAD COME TO HERIT WAS INDEED A PART OF IT FOR IF SHE WAS BEGINNING TO LOVE ROLLIN PAGE IT WAS THE CHRISTIAN MAN SHE HAD BEGUN TO LOVE THE OTHER NEVER WOULD HAVE MOVED HER TO THIS GREAT CHANGEAND ROLLIN AS HE WENT BACK TREASURED A HOPE THAT HAD BEEN A STRANGER TO HIM SINCE RACHEL HAD SAID NO THAT DAYIN THAT HOPE HE WENT ON WITH HIS WORK AS THE DAYS SPED ON AND AT NO TIME WAS HE MORE SUCCESSFUL IN REACHING AND SAVING HIS OLD ACQUAINTANCES THAN IN THE TIME THAT FOLLOWED THAT CHANCE MEETING WITH RACHEL WINSLOWTHE SUMMER HAD GONE AND RAYMOND WAS ONCE MORE FACING THE RIGOR OF HER WINTER SEASON VIRGINIA HAD BEEN ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH A PART OF HER PLAN FOR CAPTURING THE RECTANGLE AS SHE CALLED ITBUT THE BUILDING OF HOUSES IN THE FIELD THE TRANSFORMING OF ITS BLEAK BARE ASPECT INTO AN ATTRACTIVE PARK ALL OF WHICH WAS INCLUDED IN HER PLAN WAS A WORK TOO LARGE TO BE COMPLETED THAT FALL AFTER SHE HAD SECURED THE PROPERTYBUT A MILLION DOLLARS IN THE HANDS OF A PERSON WHO TRULY WANTS TO DO WITH IT AS JESUS WOULDOUGHT TO ACCOMPLISH WONDERS FOR HUMANITY IN A SHORT TIME AND HENRY MAXWELL GOING OVER TO THE SCENE OF THE NEW WORK ONE DAY AFTER A NOON HOUR WITH THE SHOP MEN WAS AMAZED TO SEE HOW MUCH HAD BEEN DONE OUTWARDLYYET HE WALKED HOME THOUGHTFULLY AND ON HIS WAY HE COULD NOT AVOID THE QUESTION OF THE CONTINUAL PROBLEM THRUST UPON HIS NOTICE BY THE SALOON HOW MUCH HAD BEEN DONE FOR THE RECTANGLE AFTER ALLEVEN COUNTING VIRGINIA'S AND RACHEL'S WORK AND MISTER GRAY'S WHERE HAD IT ACTUALLY COUNTED IN ANY VISIBLE QUANTITYOF COURSE HE SAID TO HIMSELF THE REDEMPTIVE WORK BEGUN AND CARRIED ON BY THE HOLY SPIRIT IN HIS WONDERFUL DISPLAYS OF POWER IN THE FIRST CHURCH AND IN THE TENT MEETINGS HAD HAD ITS EFFECT UPON THE LIFE OF RAYMONDBUT AS HE WALKED PAST SALOON AFTER SALOON AND NOTED THE CROWDS GOING IN AND COMING OUT OF THEM AS HE SAW THE WRETCHED DENS AS MANY AS EVER APPARENTLYHE SICKENED AT THE SIGHT HE FOUND HIMSELF ASKING HOW MUCH CLEANSING COULD A MILLION DOLLARS POURED INTO THIS CESSPOOL ACCOMPLISHWAS NOT THE LIVING SOURCE OF NEARLY ALL THE HUMAN MISERY THEY SOUGHT TO RELIEVE UNTOUCHED AS LONG AS THE SALOONS DID THEIR DEADLY BUT LEGITIMATE WORKWAS IT NOT A PRACTICAL WASTE OF BEAUTIFUL LIVES FOR THESE YOUNG WOMEN TO THROW THEMSELVES INTO THIS EARTHLY HELL WHEN FOR EVERY SOUL RESCUED BY THEIR SACRIFICE THE SALOON MADE TWO MORE THAT NEEDED RESCUE HE COULD NOT ESCAPE THE QUESTIONIT WAS THE SAME THAT VIRGINIA HAD PUT TO RACHEL IN HER STATEMENT THAT IN HER OPINION NOTHING REALLY PERMANENT WOULD EVER BE DONE UNTIL THE SALOON WAS TAKEN OUT OF THE RECTANGLEHENRY MAXWELL WENT BACK TO HIS PARISH WORK THAT AFTERNOON WITH ADDED CONVICTIONS ON THE LICENSE BUSINESS BUT IF THE SALOON WAS A FACTOR IN THE PROBLEM OF THE LIFE OF RAYMOND NO LESS WAS THE FIRST CHURCH AND ITS LITTLE COMPANY OF DISCIPLES WHO HAD PLEDGED TO DO AS JESUS WOULD DOHENRY MAXWELL STANDING AT THE VERY CENTRE OF THE MOVEMENT WAS NOT IN A POSITION TO JUDGE OF ITS POWER AS SOME ONE FROM THE OUTSIDE MIGHT HAVE DONE BUT RAYMOND ITSELF FELT THE TOUCH IN VERY MANY WAYS NOT KNOWING ALL THE REASONS FOR THE CHANGETHE WINTER WAS GONE AND THE YEAR WAS ENDED THE YEAR WHICH HENRY MAXWELL HAD FIXED AS THE TIME DURING WHICH THE PLEDGE SHOULD BE KEPT TO DO AS JESUS WOULD DO SUNDAY THE ANNIVERSARY OF THAT ONE A YEAR AGO WAS IN MANY WAYS THE MOST REMARKABLE DAY THAT THE FIRST CHURCH EVER KNEWIT WAS NOT UNTIL THE MINING BOOM AT THE TIME WHEN EVERYBODY WENT SIMPLY CRAZY OVER THE COBALT AND PORCUPINE MINES OF THE NEW SILVER COUNTRY NEAR THE HUDSON BAYTHERE WERE ALWAYS PEOPLE GOING IN AND OUT OF THE BARBER SHOP MULLINS THE MANAGER OF THE EXCHANGE BANK TOOK HIS MORNING SHAVE FROM JEFF AS A FORM OF RESUSCITATION WITH ENOUGH WET TOWELS LAID ON HIS FACE TO STEW HIM AND WITH JEFF MOVING ABOUT IN THE STEAM RAZOR IN HANDAS GRAVE AS AN OPERATING SURGEON THEN AS I THINK I SAID MISTER SMITH CAME IN EVERY MORNING AND THERE WAS A TREMENDOUS OUTPOURING OF FLORIDA WATER AND RUMS ESSENCES AND REVIVERS AND RENOVATORS REGARDLESS OF EXPENSEWHAT WITH JEFF'S WHITE COAT AND MISTER SMITH'S FLOWERED WAISTCOAT AND THE RED GERANIUM IN THE WINDOW AND THE FLORIDA WATER AND THE DOUBLE EXTRACT OF HYACINTH THE LITTLE SHOP SEEMED MULTI COLOURED AND LUXURIOUS ENOUGH FOR THE ANNEX OF A SULTAN'S HAREM BUT WHAT I MEAN IS THATTILL THE MINING BOOM JEFFERSON THORPE NEVER OCCUPIED A POSITION OF REAL PROMINENCE IN MARIPOSAEVERYBODY KNEW JEFF AND LIKED HIM BUT THE ODD THING WAS THAT TILL HE MADE MONEY NOBODY TOOK ANY STOCK IN HIS IDEAS AT ALL IT WAS ONLY AFTER HE MADE THE CLEAN UP THAT THEY CAME TO SEE WHAT A SPLENDID FELLOW HE WAS LEVEL HEADED I THINK WAS THE TERM INDEEDIN THE SPEECH OF MARIPOSA THE HIGHEST FORM OF ENDOWMENT WAS TO HAVE THE HEAD SET ON HORIZONTALLY AS WITH A THEODOLITE AS I SAY IT WAS WHEN JEFF MADE MONEY THAT THEY SAW HOW GIFTED HE WAS AND WHEN HE LOST IT BUT STILL THERE'S NO NEED TO GO INTO THATI BELIEVE IT'S SOMETHING THE SAME IN OTHER PLACES TOO THE BARBER SHOP YOU WILL REMEMBER STANDS ACROSS THE STREET FROM SMITH'S HOTEL AND STARES AT IT FACE TO FACE IT IS ONE OF THOSE WOODEN STRUCTURES I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU KNOW THEMWITH A FALSE FRONT THAT STICKS UP ABOVE ITS REAL HEIGHT AND GIVES IT AN AIR AT ONCE RECTANGULAR AND IMPOSING IT IS A FORM OF ARCHITECTURE MUCH USED IN MARIPOSA AND UNDERSTOOD TO BE IN KEEPING WITH THE PRETENTIOUS AND ARTIFICIAL CHARACTER OF MODERN BUSINESSAND THE SHOP ITSELF HAS A LARGE SQUARE WINDOW OUT OF PROPORTION TO ITS LITTLE FLAT FACE PAINTED ON THE PANES OF THE WINDOW IS THE REMAINS OF A LEGEND THAT ONCE SPELT BARBER SHOP EXECUTED WITH THE FLOURISHES THAT PREVAILED IN THE GOLDEN AGE OF SIGN PAINTING IN MARIPOSATHROUGH THE WINDOW YOU CAN SEE THE GERANIUMS IN THE WINDOW SHELF AND BEHIND THEM JEFF THORPE WITH HIS LITTLE BLACK SCULL CAP ON AND HIS SPECTACLES DROOPED UPON HIS NOSE AS HE BENDS FORWARD IN THE ABSORPTION OF SHAVINGAS YOU OPEN THE DOOR IT SETS IN VIOLENT AGITATION A COILED SPRING UP ABOVE AND A BELL THAT ALMOST RINGS INSIDE THERE ARE TWO SHAVING CHAIRS OF THE HEAVIER OR ELECTROCUTION PATTERNIT IS THE CURRENT SUPPOSITION OF EACH OF JEFF'S CUSTOMERS THAT EVERYONE ELSE BUT HIMSELF USES A SEPARATE MUG ONE CORNER OF THE SHOP IS PARTITIONED OFF AND BEARS THE SIGN HOT AND COLD BATHS FIFTY CENTSONLY OLD NEWSPAPERS AND A MOP STILL IT LENDS DISTINCTION SOMEHOW JUST AS DO THE FADED CARDBOARD SIGNS THAT HANG AGAINST THE MIRROR WITH THE LEGENDS TURKISH SHAMPOO SEVENTY FIVE CENTS AND ROMAN MASSAGE ONE DOLLARTHEY SAID COMMONLY IN MARIPOSA THAT JEFF MADE MONEY OUT OF THE BARBER SHOP HE MAY HAVE AND IT MAY HAVE BEEN THAT THAT TURNED HIS MIND TO INVESTMENT BUT IT'S HARD TO SEE HOW HE COULD A SHAVE COST FIVE CENTS AND A HAIR CUT FIFTEEN OR THE TWO IF YOU LIKED FOR A QUARTERAND AT THAT IT IS HARD TO SEE HOW HE COULD MAKE MONEYAND THEN IN THE OTHER YOU SEE IN MARIPOSA SHAVING ISN'T THE HURRIED PERFUNCTORY THING THAT IT IS IN THE CITY A SHAVE IS LOOKED UPON AS A FORM OF PHYSICAL PLEASURE AND LASTS ANYWHERE FROM TWENTY FIVE MINUTES TO THREE QUARTERS OF AN HOUR IN THE MORNING HOURS PERHAPS THERE WAS A SEMBLANCE OF HASTE ABOUT ITTHE RAZOR WOULD GO SLOWER AND SLOWER AND PAUSE AND STOP MOVE AND PAUSE AGAIN TILL THE SHAVE DIED AWAY INTO THE MERE DROWSE OF CONVERSATION AT SUCH HOURS THE MARIPOSA BARBER SHOP WOULD BECOME A VERY PALACE OF SLUMBERAND AS YOU WAITED YOUR TURN IN ONE OF THE WOODEN ARM CHAIRS BESIDE THE WALL WHAT WITH THE QUIET OF THE HOUR AND THE LOW DRONE OF JEFF'S CONVERSATION THE BUZZING OF THE FLIES AGAINST THE WINDOW PANE AND THE MEASURED TICK OF THE CLOCK ABOVE THE MIRRORYOUR HEAD SANK DREAMING ON YOUR BREAST AND THE MARIPOSA NEWSPACKET RUSTLED UNHEEDED ON THE FLOOR IT MAKES ONE DROWSY JUST TO THINK OF IT THE CONVERSATION OF COURSE WAS THE REAL CHARM OF THE PLACE YOU SEE JEFFERSON'S FORTE OR SPECIALTY WAS INFORMATIONWHERE HE GOT IT ALL I DON'T KNOW BUT I AM INCLINED TO THINK IT CAME MORE OR LESS OUT OF THE NEWSPAPERS IN THE CITY PEOPLE NEVER READ THE NEWSPAPERS NOT REALLY ONLY LITTLE BITS AND SCRAPS OF THEM BUT IN MARIPOSA IT'S DIFFERENT THERETHEY READ THE WHOLE THING FROM COVER TO COVER AND THEY BUILD UP ON IT IN THE COURSE OF YEARS A RANGE OF ACQUIREMENT THAT WOULD PUT A COLLEGE PRESIDENT TO THE BLUSHAND OF COURSE THE PECULIARITY OF JEFF'S CONVERSATION WAS THAT HE COULD SUIT IT TO HIS MAN EVERY TIMETHERE WAS A CERTAIN KIND OF MAN THAT JEFF WOULD SIZE UP SIDEWAYS AS HE STROPPED THE RAZOR AND IN WHOSE EAR HE WOULD WHISPER I SEE WHERE SAINT LOUIS HAS TOOK FOUR STRAIGHT GAMES OFF CHICAGO AND SO HOLD HIM FASCINATED TO THE END IN THE SAME WAY HE WOULD SAY TO MISTER SMITHI SEE WHERE IT SAYS THAT THIS FLYING SQUIRL RUN A DEAD HEAT FOR THE KING'S PLATE TO A HUMBLE INTELLECT LIKE MINE HE WOULD EXPLAIN IN FULL THE RELATIONS OF THE KEESAR TO THE GERMAN RICH DOGTHE HUGE FORTUNES THAT A MAN WITH THE RIGHT KIND OF HEAD COULD MAKE I'VE KNOWN JEFFERSON TO PAUSE IN HIS SHAVING WITH THE RAZOR SUSPENDED IN THE AIR AS LONG AS FIVE MINUTES WHILE HE DESCRIBED WITH HIS EYE HALF CLOSEDEXACTLY THE KIND OF A HEAD A MAN NEEDED IN ORDER TO MAKE A HAUL OR A CLEAN UP IT WAS EVIDENTLY SIMPLY A MATTER OF THE HEAD AND AS FAR AS ONE COULD JUDGE JEFF'S OWN WAS THE VERY TYPE REQUIRED I DON'T KNOW JUST AT WHAT TIME OR HOW JEFFERSON FIRST BEGAN HIS SPECULATIVE ENTERPRISESIT WAS PROBABLY IN HIM FROM THE START THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THE VERY IDEA OF SUCH THINGS AS TRACTION STOCK AND AMALGAMATED ASBESTOS WENT TO HIS HEAD AND WHENEVER HE SPOKE OF MISTER CARNEGIE AND MISTER ROCKEFELLER THE YEARNING TONE OF HIS VOICE MADE IT AS SOFT AS LATHERED SOAPI SUPPOSE THE MOST RUDIMENTARY FORM OF HIS SPECULATION WAS THE HENS THAT WAS YEARS AGO HE KEPT THEM OUT AT THE BACK OF HIS HOUSE WHICH ITSELF STOOD UP A GRASS PLOT BEHIND AND BEYOND THE BARBER SHOP AND IN THE OLD DAYS JEFF WOULD SAY WITH A CERTAIN NOTE OF PRIDE IN HIS VOICETHAT THE WOMAN HAD SOLD AS MANY AS TWO DOZEN EGGS IN A DAY TO THE SUMMER VISITORS BUT WHAT WITH READING ABOUT AMALGAMATED ASBESTOS AND CONSOLIDATED COPPER AND ALL THAT THE HENS BEGAN TO SEEM PRETTY SMALL BUSINESS AND IN ANY CASE THE IDEA OF TWO DOZEN EGGS AT A CENT APIECE ALMOST MAKES ONE BLUSHI SUPPOSE A GOOD MANY OF US HAVE FELT JUST AS JEFF DID ABOUT OUR POOR LITTLE EARNINGS ANYWAY I REMEMBER JEFF TELLING ME ONE DAY THAT HE COULD TAKE THE WHOLE LOT OF THE HENS AND SELL THEM OFF AND CRACK THE MONEY INTO CHICAGO WHEAT ON MARGIN AND TURN IT OVER IN TWENTY FOUR HOURS HE DID IT TOOAFTER THAT THE HEN HOUSE STOOD EMPTY AND THE WOMAN HAD TO THROW AWAY CHICKEN FEED EVERY DAY AT A DEAD LOSS OF PERHAPS A SHAVE AND A HALFAND RIGHT AT OUR VERY DOORS YOU COULD SEE AS I SAW THE NIGHT EXPRESS GOING NORTH EVERY EVENING FOR ALL ONE KNEW ROCKEFELLER OR CARNEGIE OR ANYONE MIGHT BE ON ITSO NO WONDER THE TOWN WENT WILD ALL DAY IN THE STREET YOU COULD HEAR MEN TALKING OF VEINS AND SMELTERS AND DIPS AND DEPOSITS AND FAULTS THE TOWN HUMMED WITH IT LIKE A GEOLOGY CLASS ON EXAMINATION DAYWITHIN A FORTNIGHT THEY PUT A PARTITION DOWN ROBERTSON'S COAL AND WOOD OFFICE AND OPENED THE MARIPOSA MINING EXCHANGE AND JUST ABOUT EVERY MAN ON THE MAIN STREET STARTED BUYING SCRIP THEN PRESENTLY YOUNG FIZZLECHIP WHO HAD BEEN TELLER IN MULLINS'S BANK AND THAT EVERYBODY HAD THOUGHT A WORTHLESS JACKASS BEFORECAME BACK FROM THE COBALT COUNTRY WITH A FORTUNE AND LOAFED ROUND IN THE MARIPOSA HOUSE IN ENGLISH KHAKI AND A HORIZONTAL HAT DRUNK ALL THE TIMETHEY ALL WENT IN JIM ELIOT MORTGAGED THE INSIDE OF THE DRUG STORE AND JAMMED IT INTO TWIN TAMAGAMI PETE GLOVER AT THE HARDWARE STORE BOUGHT NIPPEWA STOCK AT THIRTEEN CENTS AND SOLD IT TO HIS BROTHER AT SEVENTEEN AND BOUGHT IT BACK IN LESS THAN A WEEK AT NINETEEN THEY DIDN'T CARE THEY TOOK A CHANCEJUDGE PEPPERLEIGH PUT THE REST OF HIS WIFE'S MONEY INTO TEMISKAMING COMMON AND LAWYER MACARTNEY GOT THE FEVER TOO AND PUT EVERY CENT THAT HIS SISTER POSSESSED INTO TULIP PREFERRED AND EVEN WHEN YOUNG FIZZLECHIP SHOT HIMSELF IN THE BACK ROOM OF THE MARIPOSA HOUSE MISTER GINGHAM BURIED HIM IN A CASKET WITH SILVER HANDLESTHEY ALL WENT IN OR ALL EXCEPT MISTER SMITH YOU SEE MISTER SMITH HAD COME DOWN FROM THERE AND HE KNEW ALL ABOUT ROCKS AND MINING AND CANOES AND THE NORTH COUNTRY HE KNEW WHAT IT WAS TO EAT FLOUR BAKED DAMPERS UNDER THE LEE SIDE OF A CANOE PROPPED AMONG THE UNDERBRUSHBUT JEFF THORPE WAS IN THE MINING BOOM RIGHT FROM THE START HE BOUGHT IN ON THE NIPPEWA MINE EVEN BEFORE THE INTERIM PROSPECTUS WAS OUTAND HE AND JOHNSON THE LIVERY STABLEKEEPER NEXT DOOR FORMED A SYNDICATEAND THEN UNLOADED THEM ON ONE OF THE SAUSAGE MEN AT NETLEY'S BUTCHER SHOP AT A CLEAR CENT PER CENT ADVANCE JEFF WOULD OPEN THE LITTLE DRAWER BELOW THE MIRROR IN THE BARBER SHOP AND SHOW YOU ALL KINDS AND SORTS OF COBALT COUNTRY MINING CERTIFICATESBLUE ONES PINK ONES GREEN ONES WITH OUTLANDISH AND FASCINATING NAMES ON THEM THAT RAN CLEAR FROM THE MATTAWA TO THE HUDSON BAY AND RIGHT FROM THE START HE WAS CONFIDENT OF WINNING THERE AIN'T NO DIFFICULTY TO IT HE SAIDI DON'T SAY HE USED TO CONTINUE WITH THE SCISSORS OPEN AND READY TO CUTBUT IF A FELLER KNOWS THE COUNTRY AND KEEPS HIS HEAD LEVEL HE CAN'T LOSE JEFFERSON HAD LOOKED AT SO MANY PROSPECTUSES AND SO MANY PICTURES OF MINES AND PINE TREES AND SMELTERS THAT I THINK HE'D FORGOTTEN THAT HE'D NEVER BEEN IN THE COUNTRY ANYWAY WHAT'S TWO HUNDRED MILESTO AN ONLOOKER IT CERTAINLY DIDN'T SEEM SO SIMPLE I NEVER KNEW THE MEANNESS THE TRICKERY OF THE MINING BUSINESS THE SHEER OBSTINATE DETERMINATION OF THE BIGGER CAPITALISTS NOT TO MAKE MONEY WHEN THEY MIGHT TILL I HEARD THE ACCOUNTS OF JEFF'S DIFFERENT MINES TAKE THE CASE OF CORONA JEWELTHERE WAS A GOOD MINE SIMPLY GOING TO RUIN FOR LACK OF COMMON SENSE SHE AIN'T BEEN DEVELOPED JEFF WOULD SAY THERE'S SILVER ENOUGH IN HER SO YOU COULD DIG IT OUT WITH A SHOVEL SHE'S FULL OF IT BUT THEY WON'T GET AT HER AND WORK HERTHEN HE'D TAKE A LOOK AT THE PINK AND BLUE CERTIFICATES OF THE CORONA JEWEL AND SLAM THE DRAWER ON THEM IN DISGUST WORSE THAN THAT WAS THE SILENT PINE A CLEAR CASE OF STUPID INCOMPETENCEUTTER LACK OF ENGINEERING SKILL WAS ALL THAT WAS KEEPING THE SILENT PINE FROM MAKING A FORTUNE FOR ITS HOLDERS THE ONLY TROUBLE WITH THAT MINE SAID JEFF IS THEY WON'T GO DEEP ENOUGHIF THEY'D JUST GO RIGHT INTO HER GOOD THEY'D GET IT AGAIN SHE'S DOWN THERE ALL RIGHT BUT PERHAPS THE MEANEST CASE OF ALL WAS THE NORTHERN STAR THAT ALWAYS SEEMED TO ME EVERY TIME I HEARD OF IT A STRAIGHT CASE FOR THE CRIMINAL LAW THE THING WAS SO EVIDENTLY A CONSPIRACYI BOUGHT HER SAID JEFF AT THIRTY TWO AND SHE STAYED RIGHT THERE TIGHT LIKE SHE WAS STUCKAND I HELD ON TO HER AND THEY SHOVED HER DOWN TO TWENTY ONE THIS MORNING THEY'VE GOT HER DOWN TO SIXTEEN BUT I DON'T MEAN TO LET GO NO SIR IN ANOTHER FORTNIGHT THEY SHOVED HER THE SAME UNSCRUPULOUS CROWD DOWN TO NINE CENTS AND JEFFERSON STILL HELD ONA FEW DAYS AFTER THAT THE SAME CRIMINAL GANG HAD HER DOWN FURTHER THAN EVER THEY'VE GOT HER DOWN TO THREE CENTS SAID JEFF BUT I'M WITH HER YES SIR THEY THINK THEY CAN SHOVE HER CLEAN OFF THE MARKET BUT THEY CAN'T DO IT I'VE BOUGHTEN IN JOHNSON'S SHARESAND THEN AND THEN WELL THAT'S JUST THE QUEER THING ABOUT THE MINING BUSINESS WHY SUDDEN AS A FLASH OF LIGHTNING IT SEEMED THE NEWS CAME OVER THE WIRE TO THE MARIPOSA NEWSPACKET THAT THEY HAD STRUCK A VEIN OF SILVER IN THE NORTHERN STAR AS THICK AS A SIDEWALKAND THAT THE STOCK HAD JUMPED TO SEVENTEEN DOLLARS A SHARE AND EVEN AT THAT YOU COULDN'T GET IT AND JEFF STOOD THERE FLUSHED AND HALF STAGGERED AGAINST THE MIRROR OF THE LITTLE SHOP WITH A BUNCH OF MINING SCRIP IN HIS HAND THAT WAS WORTH FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARSEXCITEMENT IT WAS ALL OVER THE TOWN IN A MINUTESAND IN LESS THAN NO TIME THERE WASN'T STANDING ROOM IN THE BARBER SHOP AND OVER IN SMITH'S HOTEL THEY HAD THREE EXTRA BARKEEPERS WORKING ON THE LAGER BEER PUMPSAND PEOPLE WERE JUST CLUTCHING FOR THEM THEN AT NIGHT THERE WAS A BIG OYSTER SUPPER IN SMITH'S CAFF WITH SPEECHES AND THE MARIPOSA BAND OUTSIDE AND THE QUEER THING WAS THAT THE VERY NEXT AFTERNOON WAS THE FUNERAL OF YOUNG FIZZLECHIPA PERFECT ILIAD WHILE HE WAS CLINGING TO HER THE WHOLE THING WAS IN THE CITY PAPERS A FEW DAYS AFTER WITH A PHOTOGRAPH OF JEFF TAKEN SPECIALLY AT ED MOORE'S STUDIO UPSTAIRS OVER NETLEY'S IT SHOWED JEFF SITTING AMONG PALM TREES AS ALL MINING MEN DOWITH ONE HAND ON HIS KNEE AND A DOG ONE OF THOSE REGULAR MINING DOGS AT HIS FEET AND A LOOK OF PIERCING INTELLIGENCE IN HIS FACE THAT WOULD EASILY ACCOUNT FOR FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS I SAY THAT THE RECOGNITION MEANT A LOT TO JEFF FOR ITS OWN SAKETHAT UNLESS YOU HEAR ABOUT THEM SEPARATELY AND ONE BY ONE YOU CAN'T FOR A MOMENT UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY'RE LIKEON HER HIGH STOOL WITH A STEEL CAP ON JABBING THE CONNECTING PLUGS IN AND OUT AS IF ELECTRICITY COST NOTHING WELLTHERE WAS MYRA WHO TREATED LOVERS LIKE DOGS AND WOULD SLAP THEM ACROSS THE FACE WITH A BANANA SKIN TO SHOW HER UTTER INDEPENDENCE AND THERE WAS MISS CLEGHORN WHO WAS SALLOW AND WHO BOUGHT A FORTY CENT ANCIENT HISTORY TO IMPROVE HERSELF AND YET IF SHE'D HIT ANY MAN IN MARIPOSA WITH A BANANA SKINHE'D HAVE HAD HER ARRESTED FOR ASSAULT MIND YOU I DON'T MEAN THAT MYRA WAS MERELY FLIPPANT AND WORTHLESS NOT AT ALL SHE WAS A GIRL WITH ANY AMOUNT OF TALENT YOU SHOULD HAVE HEARD HER RECITE THE RAVEN AT THE METHODIST SOCIAL SIMPLY GENIUSAND WHEN SHE ACTED PORTIA IN THE TRIAL SCENE OF THE MERCHANT OF VENICE AT THE HIGH SCHOOL CONCERTSO OF COURSE AS SOON AS JEFF MADE THE FORTUNE MYRA HAD HER RESIGNATION IN NEXT MORNINGAND BECOME A LEADING ACTRESS BUT AS I SAID THE PUBLIC RECOGNITION COUNTED A LOT FOR JEFF THE MOMENT YOU BEGIN TO GET THAT SORT OF THING IT COMES IN QUICKLY ENOUGH BRAINS YOU KNOW ARE RECOGNIZED RIGHT AWAY THAT WAS WHY OF COURSE WITHIN A WEEK FROM THISJEFF RECEIVED THE FIRST BIG PACKET OF STUFF FROM THE CUBAN LAND DEVELOPMENT COMPANY WITH COLOURED PICTURES OF CUBA AND FIELDS OF BANANAS AND HACIENDAS AND INSURRECTOS WITH MACHETES AND HEAVEN KNOWS WHAT THEY HEARD OF HIM SOMEHOW IT WASN'T FOR A MODEST MAN LIKE JEFFERSON TO SAY HOWFOR ALL I KNOW THIS CUBAN STUFF MAY HAVE BEEN SENT FROM MORGAN HIMSELF SOME OF THE PEOPLE IN MARIPOSA SAID YES OTHERS SAID NO THERE WAS NO CERTAINTY ANYWAY THEY WERE FAIR AND STRAIGHT THIS CUBAN CROWD THAT WROTE TO JEFFAND THAT TOUCHES YOU NO THEY ASKED NO GUARANTEE JUST SEND THE MONEY WHETHER BY EXPRESS ORDER OR BY BANK DRAFT OR CHEQUE THEY LEFT THAT ENTIRELY TO ONESELF AS A MATTER BETWEEN CUBAN GENTLEMEN AND THEY WERE QUITE FRANK ABOUT THEIR ENTERPRISEBANANAS AND TOBACCO IN THE PLANTATION DISTRICT RECLAIMED FROM THE INSURRECTOS YOU COULD SEE IT ALL THERE IN THE PICTURESTHEY MADE NO RASH PROMISES JUST ADMITTED STRAIGHT OUT THAT THE ENTERPRISE MIGHT REALISE FOUR HUNDRED PER CENTI LIKED IT ABOUT JEFF THAT HE DIDN'T STOP SHAVING HE WENT ON JUST THE SAME EVEN WHEN JOHNSON THE LIVERY STABLE MAN CAME IN WITH FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS AND ASKED HIM TO SEE IF THE CUBAN BOARD OF DIRECTORS WOULD LET HIM PUT IT IN JEFF LAID IT IN THE DRAWER AND THEN SHAVED HIM FOR FIVE CENTS IN THE SAME OLD WAYA FEW DAYS LATER HE GOT A LETTER FROM THE CUBAN PEOPLE FROM NEW YORK ACCEPTING THE MONEY STRAIGHT OFF WITHOUT A SINGLE QUESTION AND WITHOUT KNOWING ANYTHING MORE OF JOHNSON EXCEPT THAT HE WAS A FRIEND OF JEFF'S THEY WROTE MOST HANDSOMELY ANY FRIENDS OF JEFF'S WERE FRIENDS OF CUBAALL MONEY THEY MIGHT SEND WOULD BE TREATED JUST AS JEFF'S WOULD BE TREATED ONE REASON PERHAPS WHY JEFF DIDN'T GIVE UP SHAVING WAS BECAUSE IT ALLOWED HIM TO TALK ABOUT CUBAAND THAT SPREAD ROUND HIM A KIND OF HALO OF WEALTH AND MYSTERY AND OUTLANDISHNESS OH SOMETHING SPANISH PERHAPS YOU'VE FELT IT ABOUT PEOPLE THAT YOU KNOW ANYHOW THEY ASKED HIM ABOUT THE CLIMATE AND YELLOW FEVER AND WHAT THE NEGROES WERE LIKE AND ALL THAT SORT OF THINGAND FOR FRUIT THEY SAY IT COMES UP SO FAST YOU CAN'T STOP IT AND THEN HE WOULD PASS INTO DETAILS ABOUT THE HASH ENDERS AND THE RESURRECTOS AND TECHNICAL THINGS LIKE THAT TILL IT WAS THOUGHT A WONDER HOW HE COULD KNOW IT STILL IT WAS REALIZED THAT A MAN WITH MONEY HAS GOT TO KNOW THESE THINGSLOOK AT MORGAN AND ROCKEFELLER AND ALL THE MEN THAT MAKE A PILE THEY KNOW JUST AS MUCH AS JEFF DID ABOUT THE COUNTRIES WHERE THEY MAKE IT IT STANDS TO REASON DID I SAY THAT JEFF SHAVED IN THE SAME OLD WAY NOT QUITEI THOUGHT THAT PERHAPS GETTING SO MUCH MONEY WELL YOU KNOW THE WAY IT ACTS ON PEOPLE IN THE LARGER CITIES IT SEEMED TO SPOIL ONE'S IDEA OF JEFF THAT COPPER AND ASBESTOS AND BANANA LANDS SHOULD FORM THE GOAL OF HIS THOUGHT WHEN IF HE KNEW ITIN FACT I HAD PERHAPS BORNE HIM A GRUDGE FOR WHAT SEEMED TO ME HIS PERPETUAL INTEREST IN THE GREAT CAPITALISTS HE ALWAYS HAD SOME ITEM OUT OF THE PAPER ABOUT THEMHE WOULD SAY AND ANOTHER DAY HE WOULD PAUSE IN THE COURSE OF SHAVING AND ALMOST WHISPER DID YOU EVER SEE THIS ROCKEFELLER IT WAS ONLY BY A SORT OF ACCIDENT THAT I CAME TO KNOW THAT THERE WAS ANOTHER SIDE TO JEFFERSON'S SPECULATION THAT NO ONE IN MARIPOSA EVER KNEW OR WILL EVER KNOW NOWYOU COULD SEE THE LIGHT OF THE LAMP BEHIND THE BLIND AND THROUGH THE SCREEN DOOR AS YOU CAME ALONGTHERE WAS A ROUND TABLE THAT THE WOMAN USED TO LAY FOR SUPPERAND BESIDE IT JEFF WOULD SIT WITH HIS SPECTACLES ON AND THE PAPER SPREAD OUT READING ABOUT CARNEGIE AND ROCKEFELLER NEAR HIM BUT AWAY FROM THE

THE HUMAN HEART AT ITS MOST SUBLIME MOMENTS COMBEFERRE WHO SPOKE THUS WAS NOT AN ORPHAN HE RECALLED THE MOTHERS OF OTHER MEN AND FORGOT HIS OWNHE WAS ABOUT TO GET HIMSELF KILLED HE WAS AN EGOIST MARIUS FASTING FEVERED HAVING EMERGED IN SUCCESSION FROM ALL HOPE AND HAVING BEEN STRANDED IN GRIEF THE MOST SOMBRE OF SHIPWRECKSAND CLASSIFIED BY SCIENCE AND WHICH IS TO SUFFERING WHAT VOLUPTUOUSNESS IS TO PLEASURE DESPAIR ALSO HAS ITS ECSTASY MARIUS HAD REACHED THIS POINTHE BEHELD MEN GOING AND COMING AS THROUGH A FLAME HE HEARD VOICES SPEAKING AS AT THE BOTTOM OF AN ABYSS BUT THIS MOVED HIM THERE WAS IN THIS SCENE A POINT WHICH PIERCED AND ROUSED EVEN HIMHE HAD BUT ONE IDEA NOW TO DIE AND HE DID NOT WISH TO BE TURNED ASIDE FROM IT BUT HE REFLECTED IN HIS GLOOMY SOMNAMBULISM THAT WHILE DESTROYING HIMSELFIT IS YOUR DUTY RATHER RETORTED THE MAN YOU HAVE TWO SISTERS WHOM YOU MAINTAIN AND AN UNPRECEDENTED CONTROVERSY BROKE FORTHTHIS IS THE REPUBLIC AND UNIVERSAL SUFFRAGE REIGNS DO YOU YOURSELVES DESIGNATE THOSE WHO ARE TO GO THEY OBEYED AFTER THE EXPIRATION OF A FEW MINUTES FIVE WERE UNANIMOUSLY SELECTEDAND STEPPED OUT OF THE RANKS THERE ARE FIVE OF THEM EXCLAIMED MARIUS THERE WERE ONLY FOUR UNIFORMS WELL BEGAN THE FIVE ONE MUST STAY BEHINDAND THEN A STRUGGLE AROSE AS TO WHO SHOULD REMAIN AND WHO SHOULD FIND REASONS FOR THE OTHERS NOT REMAINING THE GENEROUS QUARREL BEGAN AFRESH YOU HAVE A WIFE WHO LOVES YOUDO YOU DESIGNATE WHO IS TO REMAIN YES SAID THE FIVE CHOOSE WE WILL OBEY YOU MARIUS DID NOT BELIEVE THAT HE WAS CAPABLE OF ANOTHER EMOTIONWHICH ONE BEHOLDS IN THE DEPTHS OF HISTORY HOVERING OVER THERMOPYLAEAND MARIUS STUPIDLY COUNTED THEM THERE WERE STILL FIVE OF THEM THEN HIS GLANCE DROPPED TO THE FOUR UNIFORMS AT THAT MOMENT A FIFTH UNIFORM FELL AS IF FROM HEAVEN UPON THE OTHER FOURTHE FIFTH MAN WAS SAVEDTHANKS TO HIS DRESS OF A NATIONAL GUARDSMAN HE HAD MADE HIS WAY WITHOUT DIFFICULTY THE SENTINEL STATIONED BY THE INSURGENTS IN THE RUE MONDETOUR HAD NO OCCASION TO GIVE THE ALARM FOR A SINGLE NATIONAL GUARDSMANAND HE HAD SILENTLY REMOVED HIS COAT AND FLUNG IT ON THE PILE WITH THE REST THE EMOTION AROUSED WAS INDESCRIBABLEIT WAS THE REFLECTION OF THE TORCH WHICH WAS BURNING IN THE CORINTHE BARRICADE MARIUS DIRECTED HIS STEPS TOWARDS THAT RED LIGHTHAD PRESERVED WITH THE OUTSIDE WORLD AT THE CORNER OF THE LAST HOUSE ON HIS LEFT HE THRUST HIS HEAD FORWARD AND LOOKED INTO THE FRAGMENT OF THE RUE MONDETOURWHICH CAST A BROAD CURTAIN OF SHADOW IN WHICH HE WAS HIMSELF ENGULFED HE PERCEIVED SOME LIGHT ON THE PAVEMENT A BIT OF THE WINE SHOP AND BEYOND A FLICKERING LAMP WITHIN A SORT OF SHAPELESS WALL AND MEN CROUCHING DOWN WITH GUNS ON THEIR KNEESALL THIS WAS TEN FATHOMS DISTANT FROM HIM IT WAS THE INTERIOR OF THE BARRICADE THE HOUSES WHICH BORDERED THE LANE ON THE RIGHT CONCEALED THE REST OF THE WINE SHOP THE LARGE BARRICADE AND THE FLAG FROM HIMMARIUS HAD BUT A STEP MORE TO TAKEFOLDED HIS ARMS AND FELL TO THINKING ABOUT HIS FATHER HE THOUGHT OF THAT HEROIC COLONEL PONTMERCY WHO HAD BEEN SO PROUD A SOLDIER WHO HAD GUARDED THE FRONTIER OF FRANCE UNDER THE REPUBLICHIS COCKADE BLACKENED WITH POWDER HIS BROW FURROWED WITH HIS HELMET IN BARRACKS IN CAMP IN THE BIVOUACAT THE EXPIRATION OF TWENTY YEARS HAD RETURNED FROM THE GREAT WARS WITH A SCARRED CHEEK A SMILING COUNTENANCE TRANQUIL ADMIRABLE PURE AS A CHILD HAVING DONE EVERYTHING FOR FRANCE AND NOTHING AGAINST HERTO OFFER HIS BREAST TO BAYONETS TO SHED HIS BLOOD TO SEEK THE ENEMY TO SEEK DEATH THAT HE WAS ABOUT TO WAGE WAR IN HIS TURN AND DESCEND TO THE FIELD OF BATTLE AND THAT THE FIELD OF BATTLE UPON WHICH HE WAS TO DESCEND WAS THE STREETHE THOUGHT OF HIS FATHER'S SWORD WHICH HIS GRANDFATHER HAD SOLD TO A SECOND HAND DEALER AND WHICH HE HAD SO MOURNFULLY REGRETTED HE SAID TO HIMSELF THAT THAT CHASTE AND VALIANT SWORD HAD DONE WELL TO ESCAPE FROM HIMAND TO DEPART IN WRATH INTO THE GLOOM THAT IF IT HAD THUS FLED IT WAS BECAUSE IT WAS INTELLIGENT AND BECAUSE IT HAD FORESEEN THE FUTURE THAT IT HAD HAD A PRESENTIMENT OF THIS REBELLION THE WAR OF THE GUTTERSBLOWS GIVEN AND RECEIVED IN THE REAR IT WAS BECAUSE COMING FROM MARENGO AND FRIEDLAND IT DID NOT WISH TO GO TO THE RUE DE LA CHANVRERIE IT WAS BECAUSE AFTER WHAT IT HAD DONE WITH THE FATHER IT DID NOT WISH TO DO THIS FOR THE SONHE TOLD HIMSELF THAT IF THAT SWORD WERE THERE IF AFTER TAKING POSSESSION OF IT AT HIS FATHER'S PILLOW HE HAD DARED TO TAKE IT AND CARRY IT OFF FOR THIS COMBAT OF DARKNESS BETWEEN FRENCHMEN IN THE STREETSIT WOULD ASSUREDLY HAVE SCORCHED HIS HANDS AND BURST OUT AFLAME BEFORE HIS EYES LIKE THE SWORD OF THE ANGELWOUND THE SIDE OF HIS COUNTRY AND THEN HE FELL TO WEEPING BITTERLY THIS WAS HORRIBLE BUT WHAT WAS HE TO DO LIVE WITHOUT COSETTE HE COULD NOT SINCE SHE WAS GONE HE MUST NEEDS DIEHAD HE NOT GIVEN HER HIS WORD OF HONOR THAT HE WOULD DIE SHE HAD GONE KNOWING THAT THIS MEANT THAT IT PLEASED HER THAT MARIUS SHOULD DIE AND THEN IT WAS CLEAR THAT SHE NO LONGER LOVED HIMSHOULD HE RETREAT AFTER GOING SO FAR SHOULD HE FLEE FROM DANGER AFTER HAVING APPROACHED IT SHOULD HE SLIP AWAY AFTER HAVING COME AND PEEPED INTO THE BARRICADE SLIP AWAY ALL IN A TREMBLE SAYING AFTER ALL I HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF IT AS IT ISWHO WERE A MERE HANDFUL AGAINST AN ARMY SHOULD HE BE UNTRUE AT ONCE TO HIS LOVE TO COUNTRY TO HIS WORD SHOULD HE GIVE TO HIS COWARDICE THE PRETEXT OF PATRIOTISM BUT THIS WAS IMPOSSIBLE AND IF THE PHANTOM OF HIS FATHER WAS THERE IN THE GLOOMALL AT ONCE HE RAISED IT A SORT OF SPLENDID RECTIFICATION HAD JUST BEEN EFFECTED IN HIS MIND THERE IS A WIDENING OF THE SPHERE OF THOUGHT WHICH IS PECULIAR TO THE VICINITY OF THE GRAVEIT MAKES ONE SEE CLEARLY TO BE NEAR DEATH THE VISION OF THE ACTION INTO WHICH HE FELT THAT HE WAS PERHAPS ON THE POINT OF ENTERING APPEARED TO HIM NO MORE AS LAMENTABLE BUT AS SUPERBHE LEFT NONE OF THEM UNANSWERED LET US SEE WHY SHOULD HIS FATHER BE INDIGNANT ARE THERE NOT CASES WHERE INSURRECTION RISES TO THE DIGNITY OF DUTYCIVIL WAR WHAT DOES THAT MEAN IS THERE A FOREIGN WAR IS NOT ALL WAR BETWEEN MEN WAR BETWEEN BROTHERS WAR IS QUALIFIED ONLY BY ITS OBJECT THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS FOREIGN OR CIVIL WARTHERE IS ONLY JUST AND UNJUST WAR UNTIL THAT DAY WHEN THE GRAND HUMAN AGREEMENT IS CONCLUDED WAR THAT AT LEAST WHICH IS THE EFFORT OF THE FUTURE WHICH IS HASTENING ON AGAINST THE PAST WHICH IS LAGGING IN THE REAR MAY BE NECESSARYWHETHER FOREIGN OR CIVIL IS INIQUITOUS IT IS CALLED CRIME OUTSIDE THE PALE OF THAT HOLY THING JUSTICE BY WHAT RIGHT DOES ONE FORM OF MAN DESPISE ANOTHER BY WHAT RIGHT SHOULD THE SWORD OF

HIS WORK AND THE NEWS OF MANDERSON'S MYSTERIOUS DEATH WITHIN HIS JURISDICTION HAD MADE HIM THE HAPPIEST CORONER IN ENGLANDTHE COURT WAS HELD IN A LONG UNFURNISHED ROOM LATELY BUILT ONTO THE HOTEL AND INTENDED TO SERVE AS A BALL ROOM OR CONCERT HALL A REGIMENT OF REPORTERS WAS ENTRENCHED IN THE FRONT SEATSAND THOSE WHO WERE TO BE CALLED ON TO GIVE EVIDENCE OCCUPIED CHAIRS TO ONE SIDE OF THE TABLE BEHIND WHICH THE CORONER SAT WHILE THE JURY IN DOUBLE ROW WITH PLASTERED HAIR AND A SPURIOUS EASE OF MANNER FLANKED HIM ON THE OTHER SIDEAN UNDISTINGUISHED PUBLIC FILLED THE REST OF THE SPACE AND LISTENED IN AN AWED SILENCE TO THE OPENING SOLEMNITIES THE NEWSPAPER MEN WELL USED TO THESETHE IDENTITY OF THE DEAD MAN WAS PROVED BY HIS WIFE THE FIRST WITNESS CALLED FROM WHOM THE CORONER AFTER SOME INQUIRY INTO THE HEALTH AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DECEASEDPROCEEDED TO DRAW AN ACCOUNT OF THE LAST OCCASION ON WHICH SHE HAD SEEN HER HUSBAND ALIVE MISSUS MANDERSON WAS TAKEN THROUGH HER EVIDENCE BY THE CORONERWITH THE SYMPATHY WHICH EVERY MAN FELT FOR THAT DARK FIGURE OF GRIEF SHE LIFTED HER THICK VEIL BEFORE BEGINNING TO SPEAK AND THE EXTREME PALENESS AND UNBROKEN COMPOSURE OF THE LADYPRODUCED A SINGULAR IMPRESSION THIS WAS NOT AN IMPRESSION OF HARDNESS INTERESTING FEMININITY WAS THE FIRST THING TO BE FELT IN HER PRESENCE SHE WAS NOT EVEN ENIGMATICBUT HER VOICE WAS LOW AND CLEAR TO THE END HER HUSBAND SHE SAID HAD COME UP TO HIS BEDROOM ABOUT HIS USUAL HOUR FOR RETIRING ON THE SUNDAY NIGHTHIS ROOM WAS REALLY A DRESSING ROOM ATTACHED TO HER OWN BEDROOM COMMUNICATING WITH IT BY A DOOR WHICH WAS USUALLY KEPT OPEN DURING THE NIGHT BOTH DRESSING ROOM AND BEDROOM WERE ENTERED BY OTHER DOORS GIVING ON THE PASSAGEAND LIKED TO SLEEP IN A SMALL ROOM SHE HAD NOT BEEN AWAKE WHEN HE CAME UP BUT HAD BEEN HALF AROUSED AS USUALLY HAPPENED WHEN THE LIGHT WAS SWITCHED ON IN HER HUSBAND'S ROOM SHE HAD SPOKEN TO HIMSHE HAD NO CLEAR RECOLLECTION OF WHAT SHE HAD SAID AS SHE HAD BEEN VERY DROWSY AT THE TIME BUT SHE HAD REMEMBERED THAT HE HAD BEEN OUT FOR A MOONLIGHT RUN IN THE CARAND WHAT TIME IT WAS SHE HAD ASKED WHAT THE TIME WASHE DID EXPLAIN WHY I REMEMBER VERY WELL WHAT HE SAID BECAUSE SHE STOPPED WITH A LITTLE APPEARANCE OF CONFUSION BECAUSE THE CORONER INSISTED GENTLYHE SAID THAT MISTER MARLOWE COULD DO IT QUITE EASILY IF HE HAD NO ACCIDENT HE SAID THAT HE HAD STARTED IN THE CAR AND THEN WALKED BACK HOME A MILE OR SO AND FELT ALL THE BETTER FOR IT DID HE SAY ANY MOREAND YOU HEARD NOTHING IN THE NIGHT NO I NEVER WOKE UNTIL MY MAID BROUGHT MY TEA IN THE MORNING AT SEVEN O'CLOCK SHE CLOSED THE DOOR LEADING TO MY HUSBAND'S ROOM AS SHE ALWAYS DIDAND I SUPPOSED HIM TO BE STILL THERE HE ALWAYS NEEDED A GREAT DEAL OF SLEEP HE SOMETIMES SLEPT UNTIL QUITE LATE IN THE MORNING I HAD BREAKFAST IN MY SITTING ROOM IT WAS ABOUT TEN WHEN I HEARD THAT MY HUSBAND'S BODY HAD BEEN FOUNDTHE WITNESS DROPPED HER HEAD AND SILENTLY WAITED FOR HER DISMISSAL BUT IT WAS NOT TO BE YET MISSUS MANDERSON THE CORONER'S VOICE WAS SYMPATHETIC BUT IT HAD A HINT OF FIRMNESS IN IT NOWTHE QUESTION I AM GOING TO PUT TO YOU MUST IN THESE SAD CIRCUMSTANCES BE A PAINFUL ONEIS IT THE FACT THAT YOUR RELATIONS WITH YOUR LATE HUSBAND HAD NOT BEEN FOR SOME TIME PAST RELATIONS OF MUTUAL AFFECTION AND CONFIDENCEHIS ATTITUDE TOWARDS ME HAD GIVEN ME GREAT ANXIETY AND SORROW HE HAD CHANGED TOWARDS ME HE HAD BECOME VERY RESERVED AND SEEMED MISTRUSTFUL I SAW MUCH LESS OF HIM THAN BEFOREHE SEEMED TO PREFER TO BE ALONE I CAN GIVE NO EXPLANATION AT ALL OF THE CHANGE I TRIED TO WORK AGAINST IT I DID ALL I COULD WITH JUSTICE TO MY OWN DIGNITY AS I THOUGHTSOMETHING WAS BETWEEN US I DID NOT KNOW WHAT AND HE NEVER TOLD ME MY OWN OBSTINATE PRIDE PREVENTED ME FROM ASKING WHAT IT WAS IN SO MANY WORDSI ONLY MADE A POINT OF BEING TO HIM EXACTLY AS I HAD ALWAYS BEEN SO FAR AS HE WOULD ALLOW ME I SUPPOSE I SHALL NEVER KNOW NOW WHAT IT WAS THE WITNESS WHOSE VOICE HAD TREMBLED IN SPITE OF HER SELF CONTROLTHEN WAS THERE NEVER ANYTHING OF THE NATURE OF WHAT THEY CALL WORDS BETWEEN YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND MA'AM NEVERTHE WORD WAS COLORLESSLY SPOKEN BUT EVERYONE FELT THAT A CRASS MISUNDERSTANDING OF THE POSSIBILITIES OF CONDUCT IN THE CASE OF A PERSON LIKE MISSUS MANDERSON HAD BEEN VISITED WITH SOME SEVERITY DID SHE KNOW THE CORONER ASKEDOF ANY OTHER MATTER WHICH MIGHT HAVE BEEN PREYING UPON HER HUSBAND'S MIND RECENTLY MISSUS MANDERSON KNEW OF NONE WHATEVER THE CORONER INTIMATED THAT HER ORDEAL WAS AT AN END AND THE VEILED LADY MADE HER WAY TO THE DOORTHE GENERAL ATTENTION WHICH FOLLOWED HER FOR A FEW MOMENTS WAS NOW EAGERLY DIRECTED UPON MARTIN WHOM THE CORONER HAD PROCEEDED TO CALL IT WAS AT THIS MOMENT THAT TRENT APPEARED AT THE DOORWAY AND EDGED HIS WAY INTO THE GREAT ROOMBUT HE DID NOT LOOK AT MARTIN HE WAS OBSERVING THE WELL BALANCED FIGURE THAT CAME QUICKLY TOWARD HIM ALONG AN OPENING PATH IN THE CROWD AND HIS EYE WAS GLOOMYHE STARTED AS HE STOOD ASIDE FROM THE DOOR WITH A SLIGHT BOW TO HEAR MISSUS MANDERSON ADDRESS HIM BY NAME IN A LOW VOICE HE FOLLOWED HER A PACE OR TWO INTO THE HALL I WANTED TO ASK YOUSHE SAID IN A VOICE NOW WEAK AND ODDLY BROKEN IF YOU WOULD GIVE ME YOUR ARM A PART OF THE WAY TO THE HOUSE I COULD NOT SEE MY UNCLE NEAR THE DOOR AND I SUDDENLY FELT RATHER FAINT I SHALL BE BETTER IN THE AIRSHE COULD DRAG HIM FROM THE PLACE THEN AGAIN SHE LEANED HEAVILY UPON IT AND WITH THAT SUPPORT AND WITH BENT HEAD SHE WALKED SLOWLY FROM THE HOTEL AND ALONG THE OAK SHADED PATH TOWARD WHITE GABLESRUSHED THROUGH HIS BRAIN IN A ROUT BUT THE TOUCH OF HER UNNERVED HAND UPON HIS ARM NEVER FOR AN INSTANT LEFT HIS CONSCIOUSNESS FILLING HIM WITH AN EXALTATION THAT ENRAGED AND BEWILDERED HIMHE WAS STILL CURSING HIMSELF FURIOUSLY BEHIND THE MASK OF CONVENTIONAL SOLICITUDE THAT HE TURNED TO THE LADY WHEN HE HAD ATTENDED HER TO THE HOUSE AND SEEN HER SINK UPON A COUCH IN THE MORNING ROOMWITH A LOOK OF SINCERE GRATITUDE IN HER EYES SHE WAS MUCH BETTER NOW SHE SAID AND A CUP OF TEA WOULD WORK A MIRACLE UPON HER SHE HOPED SHE HAD NOT TAKEN HIM AWAY FROM ANYTHING IMPORTANT SHE WAS ASHAMED OF HERSELFSHE THOUGHT SHE COULD GO THROUGH WITH IT BUT SHE HAD NOT EXPECTED THOSE LAST QUESTIONS I AM GLAD YOU DID NOT HEAR ME SHE SAID WHEN HE EXPLAINED BUT OF COURSE YOU WILL READ IT ALL IN THE REPORTSBUT IS LAUGHTER A SYNONYM OF JOYSUCH PERFECT COMPLETENESS IS NOT IN NATUREHAD GWYNPLAINE WHEN A CHILD BEEN SO WORTHY OF ATTENTION THAT HIS FACE HAD BEEN SUBJECTED TO TRANSMUTATION WHY NOTACCORDING TO ALL APPEARANCE INDUSTRIOUS MANIPULATORS OF

VAMPA WHEN HE WAS A CHILDA YOUNG MAN HE IS ONLY TWO AND TWENTY HE WILL GAIN HIMSELF A REPUTATION WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT ALBERT AT TWO AND TWENTY TO BE THUS FAMOUS YES AND AT HIS AGE ALEXANDER CAESAR AND NAPOLEONHE WAS BORN AT PAMPINARA AND ENTERED THE COUNT'S SERVICE WHEN HE WAS FIVE YEARS OLD HIS FATHER WAS ALSO A SHEPHERD WHO OWNED A SMALL FLOCK AND LIVED BY THE WOOL AND THE MILK WHICH HE SOLD AT ROME WHEN QUITE A CHILD THE LITTLE VAMPA DISPLAYED A MOST EXTRAORDINARY PRECOCITYONE DAY WHEN HE WAS SEVEN YEARS OLD HE CAME TO THE CURATE OF PALESTRINA AND ASKED TO BE TAUGHT TO READ IT WAS SOMEWHAT DIFFICULT FOR HE COULD NOT QUIT HIS FLOCK BUT THE GOOD CURATE WENT EVERY DAY TO SAY MASS AT A LITTLE HAMLET TOO POOR TO PAY A PRIEST AND WHICHEVERY DAY LUIGI LED HIS FLOCK TO GRAZE ON THE ROAD THAT LEADS FROM PALESTRINA TO BORGO EVERY DAY AT NINE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING THE PRIEST AND THE BOY SAT DOWN ON A BANK BY THE WAYSIDEAT THE END OF A WEEK HE WROTE AS WELL WITH THIS PEN AS WITH THE STYLUS THE CURATE RELATED THE INCIDENT TO THE COUNT OF SAN FELICE WHO SENT FOR THE LITTLE SHEPHERD MADE HIM READ AND WRITE BEFORE HIM ORDERED HIS ATTENDANT TO LET HIM EAT WITH THE DOMESTICS AND TO GIVE HIM TWO PIASTRES A MONTHWITH THIS LUIGI PURCHASED BOOKS AND PENCILS HE APPLIED HIS IMITATIVE POWERS TO EVERYTHING AND LIKE GIOTTO WHEN YOUNG HE DREW ON HIS SLATE SHEEP HOUSES AND TREESIT WAS THUS THAT PINELLI THE FAMOUS SCULPTOR HAD COMMENCED A GIRL OF SIX OR SEVEN THAT IS A LITTLE YOUNGER THAN VAMPA TENDED SHEEP ON A FARM NEAR PALESTRINA SHE WAS AN ORPHAN BORN AT VALMONTONE AND WAS NAMED TERESA THE TWO CHILDREN METHAD BEEN ABLE TO GAIN ANY INFLUENCE OVER HIM OR EVEN TO BECOME HIS COMPANION HIS DISPOSITION ALWAYS INCLINED TO EXACT CONCESSIONS RATHER THAN TO MAKE THEM KEPT HIM ALOOF FROM ALL FRIENDSHIPS TERESA ALONE RULED BY A LOOKTHE TWO PIASTRES THAT LUIGI RECEIVED EVERY MONTH FROM THE COUNT OF SAN FELICE'S STEWARD AND THE PRICE OF ALL THE LITTLE CARVINGS IN WOOD HE SOLD AT ROME WERE EXPENDED IN EAR RINGS NECKLACES AND GOLD HAIRPINS SO THAT THANKS TO HER FRIEND'S GENEROSITYTERESA WAS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL AND THE BEST ATTIRED PEASANT NEAR ROME THE TWO CHILDREN GREW UP TOGETHER PASSING ALL THEIR TIME WITH EACH OTHER AND GIVING THEMSELVES UP TO THE WILD IDEAS OF THEIR DIFFERENT CHARACTERSTHUS IN ALL THEIR DREAMS THEIR WISHES AND THEIR CONVERSATIONS VAMPA SAW HIMSELF THE CAPTAIN OF A VESSEL GENERAL OF AN ARMY OR GOVERNOR OF A PROVINCE TERESA SAW HERSELF RICH SUPERBLY ATTIREDAND ATTENDED BY A TRAIN OF LIVERIED DOMESTICS THEN WHEN THEY HAD THUS PASSED THE DAY IN BUILDING CASTLES IN THE AIR THEY SEPARATED THEIR FLOCKS AND DESCENDED FROM THE ELEVATION OF THEIR DREAMS TO THE REALITY OF THEIR HUMBLE POSITIONAND PROWL AROUND HIS FLOCK THE STEWARD GAVE HIM A GUN THIS WAS WHAT VAMPA LONGED FOR THIS GUN HAD AN EXCELLENT BARREL MADE AT BRESCHIA AND CARRYING A BALL WITH THE PRECISION OF AN ENGLISH RIFLE BUT ONE DAY THE COUNT BROKE THE STOCKAND HAD THEN CAST THE GUN ASIDE THIS HOWEVER WAS NOTHING TO A SCULPTOR LIKE VAMPA HE EXAMINED THE BROKEN STOCK CALCULATED WHAT CHANGE IT WOULD REQUIRE TO ADAPT THE GUN TO HIS SHOULDER AND MADE A FRESH STOCKSO BEAUTIFULLY CARVED THAT IT WOULD HAVE FETCHED FIFTEEN OR TWENTY PIASTRES HAD HE CHOSEN TO SELL IT BUT NOTHING COULD BE FARTHER FROM HIS THOUGHTS FOR A LONG TIME A GUN HAD BEEN THE YOUNG MAN'S GREATEST AMBITION IN EVERY COUNTRY WHERE INDEPENDENCE HAS TAKEN THE PLACE OF LIBERTYTHE FIRST DESIRE OF A MANLY HEART IS TO POSSESS A WEAPON WHICH AT ONCE RENDERS HIM CAPABLE OF DEFENCE OR ATTACK AND BY RENDERING ITS OWNER TERRIBLE OFTEN MAKES HIM FEARED FROM THIS MOMENT VAMPA DEVOTED ALL HIS LEISURE TIME TO PERFECTING HIMSELF IN THE USE OF HIS PRECIOUS WEAPONHE PURCHASED POWDER AND BALL AND EVERYTHING SERVED HIM FOR A MARK THE TRUNK OF SOME OLD AND MOSS GROWN OLIVETREE THAT GREW ON THE SABINE MOUNTAINS THE FOX AS HE QUITTED HIS EARTH ON SOME MARAUDING EXCURSION THE EAGLE THAT SOARED ABOVE THEIR HEADSAND THUS HE SOON BECAME SO EXPERT THAT TERESA OVERCAME THE TERROR SHE AT FIRST FELT AT THE REPORT AND AMUSED HERSELF BY WATCHING HIM DIRECT THE BALL WHEREVER HE PLEASED WITH AS MUCH ACCURACY AS IF HE PLACED IT BY HANDONE EVENING A WOLF EMERGED FROM A PINE WOOD HEAR WHICH THEY WERE USUALLY STATIONED BUT THE WOLF HAD SCARCELY ADVANCED TEN YARDS ERE HE WAS DEAD PROUD OF THIS EXPLOIT VAMPA TOOK THE DEAD ANIMAL ON HIS SHOULDERS AND CARRIED HIM TO THE FARMTHESE EXPLOITS HAD GAINED LUIGI CONSIDERABLE REPUTATION THE MAN OF SUPERIOR ABILITIES ALWAYS FINDS ADMIRERS GO WHERE HE WILL HE WAS SPOKEN OF AS THE MOST ADROIT THE STRONGEST AND THE MOST COURAGEOUS CONTADINO FOR TEN LEAGUES AROUNDAND ALTHOUGH TERESA WAS UNIVERSALLY ALLOWED TO BE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL GIRL OF THE SABINES NO ONE HAD EVER SPOKEN TO HER OF LOVE BECAUSE IT WAS KNOWN THAT SHE WAS BELOVED BY VAMPA AND YET THE TWO YOUNG PEOPLE HAD NEVER DECLARED THEIR AFFECTIONTHEY HAD GROWN TOGETHER LIKE TWO TREES WHOSE ROOTS ARE MINGLED WHOSE BRANCHES INTERTWINED AND WHOSE INTERMINGLED PERFUME RISES TO THE HEAVENS ONLY THEIR WISH TO SEE EACH OTHER HAD BECOME A NECESSITY AND THEY WOULD HAVE PREFERRED DEATH TO A DAY'S SEPARATIONTERESA WAS SIXTEEN AND

AGAINST ITS CITIZENS THE CHIEF MEN WERE CAUGHT AND SENT TO THE CAPITAL WHERE JUSTINIAN HAD THEM BOUND TO SPITS AND ROASTEDTHESE ATROCITIES WERE MERE SAMPLES OF THE GENERAL CONDUCT OF JUSTINIAN IN A FEW YEARS HE HAD MADE HIMSELF SO MUCH DETESTED THAT IT MIGHT BE SAID THAT HE HAD BEEN COMPARATIVELY POPULAR IN THE DAYS OF HIS FIRST REIGNTHE ARMY OF THE TYRANT LAID DOWN THEIR ARMS WHEN PHILIPPICUS APPROACHED AND HE WAS LED FORTH AND BEHEADED WITHOUT FURTHER DELAY AN END TOO GOOD FOR SUCH A MONSTER THE CONQUEROR ALSO SOUGHT OUT AND SLEW HIS LITTLE SON TIBERIUSWHOM THE SISTER OF THE KHAN OF THE

WAS NOT VISIBLE IN THE GREAT HALL BUT THAT HE WAS NEAR AT HAND SOON BECAME EVIDENT FROM THE CHANGE SWEETWATER NOW SAW IN AMABELFOR WHILE SHE HAD HITHERTO SAT UNDER THE UNIVERSAL GAZE WITH ONLY THE FAINT SMILE OF CONSCIOUS BEAUTY ON HER INSCRUTABLE FEATURESAND GLANCED AT THE GREAT DOOR OF ENTRANCE WITH AN EVIL EXPECTANCY THAT STARTLED EVEN SWEETWATER SO LITTLE HAD HE REALLY UNDERSTOOD THE NATURE OF THE PASSIONS LABOURING IN THAT VENOMOUS BREASTSMILED AS SHE MET HIS EYE WITH THAT CURIOUS SLOW DIPPING OF HER DIMPLES WHICH HAD MORE THAN ONCE CONFOUNDED THE CORONER AND RENDERED HER AT ONCE THE

ACTION OF HIS BEGAN THE STRUGGLE THAT WAS TO MAKE THAT DAY MEMORABLE IN MANY HEARTSAND TO HIM A FULL ATTENTION WAS BEING GIVEN IN THE HOPE THAT SOME REAL ENLIGHTENMENT WOULD COME AT LAST TO SETTLE THE QUESTIONS WHICH HAD BEEN RAISED BY AMABEL'S INCOMPLETE AND UNSATISFACTORY TESTIMONY BUT NO MAN CAN FURNISH WHAT HE DOES NOT POSSESSAND THE FEW FINAL MINUTES BEFORE NOON PASSED BY WITHOUT ANY ADDITION

COME NOW THAT HE MUST AT ONCE AND FOREVER CHOOSE BETWEEN A COURSE THAT LED SIMPLY TO PERSONAL UNHAPPINESS AND ONE THAT INVOLVED NOT ONLY HIMSELFBUT THOSE DEAREST TO HIM IN DISGRACE AND SORROW HE FELT HIMSELF WEAKEN TO THE POINT OF CLUTCHING AT WHATEVER WOULD SAVE HIM FROM THE CONSEQUENCES OF CONFESSION MORAL STRENGTH AND THAT TENACITY OF PURPOSEWHICH ONLY COMES FROM YEARS OF SELF CONTROL WERE TOO LATELY AWAKENED IN HIS BREAST TO SUSTAIN HIM NOW AS STROKE AFTER STROKE FELL ON THE EAR HE FELT HIMSELF YIELDING BEYOND RECOVERYAND HAD ALMOST TOUCHED HIS FINGER IN THE SIGNIFICANT ACTION OF ASSENT WHICH AMABEL AWAITED WITH BREATHLESS EXPECTATION WHEN WAS IT MIRACLE OR ONLY THE SUGGESTION OF HIS BETTER NATURETHE MEMORY OF A FACE FULL OF HOLY PLEADING ROSE FROM THE PAST BEFORE HIS EYES AND WITH AN INNER CRY OF MOTHER HE FLUNG HIS HAND OUT AND CLUTCHED HIS FATHER'S ARM IN A WAY TO BREAK THE CHARM OF HIS OWN DREADAND END FOREVER THE EFFECTS OF THE INTOLERABLE FASCINATION THAT WAS WORKING UPON HIM NEXT MINUTE THE LAST STROKE OF NOON RANG OUT AND THE HOUR WAS UP WHICH AMABEL HAD SET AS THE LIMIT OF HER SILENCE A PAUSEWHICH TO THEIR TWO HEARTS IF TO NO OTHERS SEEMED STRANGELY APPROPRIATE FOLLOWED THE CESSATION OF THESE SOUNDS THEN THE WITNESS WAS DISMISSED AND AMABELWHEN FREDERICK LEAPING WITH A BOUND TO HIS FEET DREW ALL EYES TOWARDS HIMSELF WITH THE CRY LET ME BE PUT ON MY OATH I HAVE TESTIMONY TO GIVE OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE IN THIS CASE THE CORONER WAS ASTOUNDEDEVERYONE WAS ASTOUNDED NO ONE HAD EXPECTED ANYTHING FROM HIM AND INSTINCTIVELY EVERY EYE TURNED TOWARDS AMABEL TO

THE MONEY OF WHICH SHE DIED POSSESSED I HAVE NEVER BEFORE ACKNOWLEDGED TO ANYONE NOT EVEN TO THE GOOD MAN WHO AWAITS THIS JURY'S VERDICTON THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT DOOR YONDER THAT SHE HAD REASONS FOR THIS GOOD REASONS REASONS OF WHICH UP TO THE VERY EVENING OF HER DEATHOR THAT I WAS THE SPECIAL OBJECT OF HER ATTENTION OR THAT WE WERE UNDER ANY MUTUAL OBLIGATIONS IN ANY WAY WHY THEN I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF GOING TO HER IN THE GREAT STRAIT IN WHICH I FOUND MYSELF ON THAT DAYI CANNOT SAY I KNEW SHE HAD MONEY IN HER HOUSE THIS I HAD UNHAPPILY BEEN MADE ACQUAINTED WITH IN AN ACCIDENTAL WAYAND QUITE CAPABLE OF DOING A VERY UNSELFISH ACT STILL THIS WOULD NOT SEEM TO BE REASON ENOUGH FOR ME TO INTRUDE UPON HER LATE AT NIGHT WITH A PLEA FOR A LARGE LOAN OF MONEY HAD I NOT BEEN IN A DESPERATE CONDITION OF MINDWHICH MADE ANY ATTEMPT SEEM REASONABLE THAT PROMISED RELIEF FROM THE UNENDURABLE BURDEN OF A PRESSING AND DISREPUTABLE DEBT I WAS OBLIGED TO HAVE MONEY A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY AND I HAD TO HAVE IT AT ONCEAS I HAD BEEN TOLD EARLY IN THE EVENING A SMALL ENTERTAINMENT WAS BEING GIVEN WHICH WOULD INSURE ITS BEING OPEN EVEN AT SO LATE AN HOUR AS MIDNIGHT MISS PAGE WHO WILL I AM SURE PARDON THE INTRODUCTION OF HER NAME INTO THIS NARRATIVEHAS TAKEN PAINS TO DECLARE TO YOU THAT IN THE EXPEDITION SHE HERSELF MADE INTO TOWN THAT EVENING SHE FOLLOWED SOME PERSON'S STEPS DOWN HILL THIS IS VERY LIKELY TRUE AND THOSE STEPS WERE PROBABLY MINE FOR AFTER LEAVING THE HOUSE BY THE GARDEN DOORAND SO HASTENED ON TILL I CAME TO THE GATE ON HIGH STREET HERE I HAD A MOMENT OF HESITATION AND THOUGHTS BITTER ENOUGH FOR ME TO RECALL THEM AT THIS MOMENT CAME INTO MY MINDBUT THEY PASSED THANK GOD AND WITH NO MORE DESPERATE FEELING THAN A SULLEN INTENTION OF HAVING MY OWN WAY ABOUT THIS MONEY I LIFTED THE LATCH OF THE FRONT DOOR AND STEPPED INOR AT LEAST TO HEAR THE SOUND OF MERRY VOICES AND LAUGHTER IN THE ROOMS ABOVE BUT NO SOUNDS OF ANY SORT AWAITED ME INDEED THE HOUSE SEEMED STRANGELY SILENT FOR ONE SO FULLY LIGHTED AND ASTONISHED AT THISI PUSHED THE DOOR AJAR AT MY LEFT AND LOOKED IN AN UNEXPECTED AND PITIFUL SIGHT AWAITED MEI SAW THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE WITH HIS HEAD SUNK FORWARD ON HIS ARMS ASLEEP THE EXPECTED GUESTS HAD FAILED TO ARRIVE AND HE TIRED OUT WITH WAITING HAD FALLEN INTO A DOZE AT THE BOARDTHIS WAS A CONDITION OF THINGS FOR WHICH I WAS NOT PREPARED MISSUS WEBB WHOM I WISHED TO SEE WAS PROBABLY UP STAIRS AND WHILE I MIGHT SUMMON HER BY A STURDY RAP ON THE DOOR BESIDE WHICH I STOOD I HAD SO LITTLE DESIRE TO WAKE HER HUSBANDOF WHOSE MENTAL CONDITION I WAS WELL AWARE THAT I COULD NOT BRING MYSELF TO MAKE ANY LOUD NOISE WITHIN HIS HEARING YET I HAD NOT THE COURAGE TO RETREAT ALL MY HOPE OF RELIEF FROM THE MANY DIFFICULTIES THAT MENACED MELAY IN THE GENEROSITY OF THIS GREAT HEARTED WOMAN AND IF OUT OF PUSILLANIMITYNOTHING BUT SHAME AND DISASTER AWAITED ME YET HOW COULD I HOPE TO LURE HER DOWN STAIRS WITHOUT NOISE I COULD NOT AND SO YIELDING TO THE IMPULSE OF THE MOMENT WITHOUT ANY REALISATIONI SLIPPED UP THE NARROW STAIRCASEFOR SHE ROSE AND MEETING MY EYE WITH A GAZE IN WHICH SHOCK AND SOME STRANGE AND POIGNANT AGONY TOTALLY INCOMPREHENSIBLE TO ME WERE STRANGELY BLENDED SHE CRIED OUT NO NO FREDERICK YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOINGIF YOU WANT MY MONEY TAKE IT IF YOU WANT MY LIFEDON'T STAIN YOURS DON'T I DID NOT UNDERSTAND HER I DID NOT KNOW UNTIL I
